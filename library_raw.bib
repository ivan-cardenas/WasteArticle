  abstract = {Previously, we have described the development of the generic mobile phone data gathering tool, EpiCollect, and an associated web application, providing two-way communication between multiple data gatherers and a project database. This software only allows data collection on the phone using a single questionnaire form that is tailored to the needs of the user (including a single GPS point and photo per entry), whereas many applications require a more complex structure, allowing users to link a series of forms in a linear or branching hierarchy, along with the addition of any number of media types accessible from smartphones and/or tablet devices (e.g., GPS, photos, videos, sound clips and barcode scanning). A much enhanced version of EpiCollect has been developed (EpiCollect+). The individual data collection forms in EpiCollect+ provide more design complexity than the single form used in EpiCollect, and the software allows the generation of complex data collection projects through the ability to link many forms together in a linear (or branching) hierarchy. Furthermore, EpiCollect+ allows the collection of multiple media types as well as standard text fields, increased data validation and form logic. The entire process of setting up a complex mobile phone data collection project to the specification of a user (project and form definitions) can be undertaken at the EpiCollect+ website using a simple 'drag and drop' procedure, with visualisation of the data gathered using Google Maps and charts at the project website. EpiCollect+ is suitable for situations where multiple users transmit complex data by mobile phone (or other Android devices) to a single project web database and is already being used for a range of field projects, particularly public health projects in sub-Saharan Africa. However, many uses can be envisaged from education, ecology and epidemiology to citizen science.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in smart sensing technologies have fostered the wide-spread utilization of smart city applications, which rely on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to work efficiently. The terms ``smart city'' and ``IoT framework'', however, have been given several definitions, without consensus. Consequently, definitions of the terms ``smart city'' and ``IoT framework'' need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term ``smart city'' are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term ``smart city'' may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.},

  abstract = {This article is a review of recent contributions in critical psychology and its close cousins, critical social psychology, critical community psychology and liberation psychology, to understand human response to climate change. It contrasts critical psychology with mainstream psychology in general terms, before introducing a critical psychological perspective on climate change. Central to this perspective is a critique of the framing of individual behaviour change as the problem and solution to climate change in mainstream psychology and a related emphasis on identifying `barriers' to proenvironmental behaviour. This framework is argued to be reductive, obscuring or downplaying the influence of a range of factors in shaping predominant responses to climate change to date, including social context, discourse, power and affect. Currently, critical psychologies set out to study the relative contribution of these factors to (in)action on climate change. A related concern is how the psychological and emotional impacts of climate change impact unevenly on communities and individuals, depending on place-based, economic, geographic and cultural differences, and give rise to experiences of injustice, inequality and disempowerment. Critical psychology does not assume these to be overriding or inevitable psychological and social responses, however. Critical psychologies also undertake research and inform interventions that highlight the role of collective understanding, activism, empowerment and resistance as the necessary foundations of a genuine shift towards sustainable societies.},

Despite the proven benefits and claimed potential of using a maptable in such processes, software applications specifically designed for this device are still scarce. Moreover, often-used applications do not fully exploit the touch functionality of a maptable, or have low usability. To address this gap, we developed and evaluated the Open Geospatial Interactive TOol (OGITO), an open-source software application designed to support collaborative spatial planning processes with a maptable. To develop such tool, we combined human-centred design and Agile software development principles in a co-design effort with intended users and stakeholders. Through iterative development cycles and feedback from users, OGITO was evolved until it satisfied user expectations. In a case study on community mapping in Sumatra, Indonesia, a sample of users evaluated OGITO's usability. Case study participants reported high satisfaction with this tool for the tasks and context given. Our research shows the added value of iterative development and user feedback for improving and further development of the tool's usability and functionality.},

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. {\textcopyright} 1991.}

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to map possible subsurface dumpsites of solid waste in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Due to limited land availability, random garbage dumping for waste disposal and reclamation has occurred in the past and continues to occur in the Kingdom. Consequently, the process causes economic stress, creates environmental hazards, and contributes to the failure of many dwellings. The input data used to achieve research objective includes data from 300 boreholes, aerial photos, LandSat images, digital elevation model, and 1969{\textendash}2015 land use maps. Data on the amounts and types of municipal solid waste (MSW) were collected from 1997 to 2017, as were the locations of 3665 deteriorated houses. All types of data are screened, georeferenced, and converted into geographic information system (GIS) formats. At first, a map of possible dumping areas is produced based on citizen testimonies, government engineer interviews, LandSat, aerial photos, and 1969 topo map, followed by data analysis of the aforementioned input data performed such as image classification, buffering, and others. In the next step, multi-criteria GIS algorithm was developed to identify, locate, and map possible sites. The criteria used are distances from dwelling outskirt and the shoreline, land use, relative elevation, and soil type based on borehole data. Lastly, ground truth validation assesses the accuracy of the obtained result. Overall, the study identified 101 confirmed dumping sites and 590 probable dumping sites. Site size is ranging from 18,000 m2 to 3.6 km2 distributed over 100 city blocks which are spread throughout the Kingdom. The Capital Governorate is the most affected by dumping, and the Southern Governorate is the least impacted. A comparison of results and ground observations yielded 87.5\% accuracy. The proposed integrated method was effective, and the obtained identification and location accuracy were acceptable. The method can be used to identify, locate, and map random dumping sites in a similar situation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The irresistible global phenomenon of climate change is widely known as an emerging challenge that threatens the sustainability of public life. This article examines climate change complexities in urban areas of Indonesia, particularly those that are the result of massive urban infrastructure development. In Indonesia, urban infrastructure development has been observed to have reduced the number of open green spaces, resulting in increased temperatures, primarily in city areas. This environmental issue is exacerbated by the presence of prolonged drought due to El Ni{\~A}{$\pm$}o. Several studies have demonstrated that climate change causes mental disorders among urban residents, characterized by emotional and cultural disengagement from their place of residence, clinically called 'solastalgia'. This term was coined by Professor Glenn Albrecht, an Australian environmentalist, formerly based in Newcastle NSW. This study examined the concept of solastalgia through ethnographic interviews with five young people who have permanently lived in the city of Yogyakarta, Indonesia for more than 20 years. This study captures their personal solastalgia experiences resulting from climate change complexities. Solastalgia, as confirmed by the respondents, covers various socio-cultural symptoms like social tension, immobility, distress, and future insecurity. The narratives of the respondents indicate that climate change in addition to urban infrastructure development has uprooted their belongingness to the city, valued by them as a space for communal cultural identity formation. Subsequently, after analyzing their subjective experiences, this study confirms that spatial development of the urban area of Yogyakarta in favor of the economy neglects the future of young people.Keywords. solastalgia, climate change, urban, Yogyakarta City.Abstrak. Perubahan iklim sebagai fenomena global yang tidak bisa dihindarkan telah dikenal luas sebagai tantangan yang muncul terhadap keberlangsungan kehidupan publik dewasa ini. Artikel ini mengkaji kompleksitas perubahan iklim di daerah perkotaan di Indonesia, terutama yang merupakan efek dari pembangunan infrastruktur besar-besaran di perkotaan.. Pembangunan infrastruktur perkotaan telah mengurangi ruang terbuka hijau dan mengakibatkan peningkatan suhu, terutama di wilayah perkotaan. Masalah lingkungan di wilayah ini diperparah oleh adanya kekeringan berkepanjangan akibat El Ni{\~A}{$\pm$}o di Indonesia. Beberapa penelitian menunjukkan bahwa fenomena perubahan iklim telah menyebabkan gangguan mental pada penduduk perkotaan, ditandai dengan diskoneksi emosi dan kultural dengan tempat tinggal mereka, yang secara klinis disebut sebagai Solastalgia. Istilah ini diciptakan oleh Profesor Glenn Albrecht, aktivis lingkungan Australia, yang sebelumnya berbasis di Newcastle NSW. Konsep ini digali melalui wawancara etnografi dengan lima orang muda yang telah hidup secara permanen selama lebih dari 20 tahun di kota Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Studi ini menangkap Solastalgia sebagai pengalaman mereka menghadapi kompleksitas dalam pembangunan di perkotaan. . Solastalgia, sebagaimana diinformasikan oleh responden, mencakup berbagai gejala sosial-budaya seperti ketegangan sosial, imobilitas, marabahaya, dan keamanan masa depan. Narasi para responden ini menunjukkan bahwa perubahan iklim, di samping pembangunan infrastruktur perkotaan, telah mencabut kepemilikan mereka terhadap kota, yang dihargai oleh mereka sebagai ruang untuk pembentukan identitas budaya komunal. Selanjutnya, selain menganalisis pengalaman subyektif mereka, penelitian ini menegaskan bahwa pengembangan spasial dari daerah perkotaan yang mendukung ekonomi mengabaikan masa depan orang muda.Kata Kunci. solastalgia, climate change, urban, Yogyakarta City.},

As opposed to nostalgia - the melancholia or homesickness experienced by individuals when separated from a loved home - solastalgia is the distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment. The paper will focus on two contexts where collaborative research teams have found solastalgia to be evident: the experiences of persistent drought in rural NSW and the impact of large-scale open-cut coal mining on individuals in the Upper Hunter Valley of NSW. In both cases, people exposed to environmental change experienced negative affect that is exacerbated by a sense of powerlessness or lack of control over the unfolding change process. Methods: Qualitative (interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (community-based surveys) research has been conducted on the lived experience of drought and mining, and the findings relevant to solastalgia are presented. Results: The authors are exploring the potential uses and applications of the concept of solastalgia for understanding the psychological impact of the increasing incidence of environmental change worldwide. Conclusions: Worldwide, there is an increase in ecosystem distress syndromes matched by a corresponding increase in human distress syndromes. The specific role played by global-scale environmental challenges to 'sense of place' and identity will be explored in the future development of the concept of solastalgia.},

  abstract = {Increasing waste generation has become a significant challenge in developing countries due to unprecedented population growth and urbanization. From the literature, many issues have been investigated that signify direct connection with the increase in waste material generation and related difficulties to handle it in a smart city. These issues are the resultants of an improper collection and disposal mechanism used for waste material, the increase in moving trends of peoples toward big cities and lack of intelligent technology used to support the municipal solid waste management system. Consequently, the management of waste material has become a challenge due to a large amount of waste littered everywhere. Furthermore, various problems also occur due to the existing systems that are not only inadequate and inefficient but also their non-scientific procedures involved in the solid waste management. In this paper, an IoT-based smart waste bin monitoring and municipal solid waste management system is proposed. This system helps to solve the problems associated with management of waste material and the IoT-based waste collection for the smart city as discussed above. The proposed system is capable in the collection of waste effectively, detection of fire in waste material and forecasting of the future waste generation. The IoT-based device performs the controlling and monitoring of the electric bins. These devices are wirelessly connected with the central hub to transmit the information about the bins filling level with the existing location. The significant advantage of the system is to collect waste material on time in order to avoid the overflow of bins that would help in saving the environment from pollution.},

We also incorporate a system model which assumes two kinds of trucks for waste collection, the Low Capacity Trucks (LCTs) and the High Capacity Trucks (HCTs). By incorporating HCTs we achieve reduction of the waste collection operational costs because route trips to the dumps are reduced due to high waste storage capacity of these trucks. Finally, the proposed models are evaluated on synthetic and real data from the city municipality of St. Petersburg, Russia. The models demonstrate consistency and correctness.},

  abstract = {Waste Management (WM) represents an important part of Smart Cities (SCs) with significant impact on modern societies. WM involves a set of processes ranging from waste collection to the recycling of the collected materials. The proliferation of sensors and actuators enable the new era of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be adopted in SCs and help in WM. Novel approaches that involve dynamic routing models combined with the IoT capabilities could provide solutions that outperform existing models. In this paper, we focus on a SC where a number of collection bins are located in different areas with sensors attached to them. We study a dynamic waste collection architecture, which is based on data retrieved by sensors. We pay special attention to the possibility of immediate WM service in high priority areas, e.g., schools or hospitals where, possibly, the presence of dangerous waste or the negative effects on human quality of living impose the need for immediate collection. This is very crucial when we focus on sensitive groups of citizens like pupils, elderly or people living close to areas where dangerous waste is rejected. We propose novel algorithms aiming at providing efficient and scalable solutions to the dynamic waste collection problem through the management of the trade-off between the immediate collection and its cost. We describe how the proposed system effectively responds to the demand as realized by sensor observations and alerts originated in high priority areas. Our aim is to minimize the time required for serving high priority areas while keeping the average expected performance at high level. Comprehensive simulations on top of the data retrieved by a SC validate the proposed algorithms on both quantitative and qualitative criteria which are adopted to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We claim that, local authorities could choose the model that best matches their needs and resources of each city.},

Trabzon City located in the northeast side of Turkey has about 185 thousand inhabitants according to Census 2000. The city shares just about 1\% of the Gross Domestic Income in Turkey. In other words, that means that Trabzon City livings have moderate revenue. The objectives of this study are to optimize for the route of collection/hauling in Trabzon City by taking consideration of data about road net, demographics and solid waste production. In order to analyse the solid waste collection/hauling process in the city, the processes were recorded by a Sony DCR-TRV145E brand video camera. To use route optimization process, data related in present spending, truck type and capacity, solid waste production, number of inhabitants and Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver data for each route were collected and all the data were analyzed with each other. For 39 districts in the city, a shortest path model was used in order to optimize solid waste collection/hauling processes, as minimum cost was aimed. The Route View Pro TM software as an optimization tool was used for that purpose. Geographic Information System (GIS) elements such as numerical pathways, demographic distribution, container distribution and solid waste production amount were integrated to the software. To give an idea, thematic container layer has 777 container location points for the entire city. After performing routes by the software, the optimized routes were compared with the present routes. Success by the optimization process was around 4-59 \% for distance and 14-65 \% for time. Consequently, a route optimization process on the street stationary container collection system will contribute a benefit by 24 \% in total cost.},

In this article, we explore ways to further this concept. The article draws on ethnographic fieldwork in a village in the mid-western region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which is surrounded by three large open-cut coal mines. Over the past decade, the mines, in particular the Peabody-owned Wilpinjong mine closest to the village, have had a significant impact on biophysical, social and temporal landscapes in the area. We argue that whilst solastalgia may help explore the relationship between the environmental and human distress triggered in these circumstances, the sense of displacement and loss that emerge are entangled with questions of power and dispossession beyond the biophysical realm. Underpinned by a phenomenological framework of analysis, we contend that place-based distress should be understood as an ontological trauma, as the fabrics of place, belonging and the social relations embedded within disrupt the ongoing sense of being associated with home. These include the means to not only link to the past, but also to imagine the future.},

  abstract = {The huge increase generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) has recently become an issue of global concern. This is because waste generation increases as the population increases and the management of this waste has equally become a bit difficult. This study aims at determining the characterization and the pattern of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ), South Africa. The results revealed that plastics and organic wastes constitute the highest waste content in both the daily refuse (DR) and round collected refuse (RCR). The results further showed that DRs are 28\% and 26\% for plastic wastes, while 28\% and 29\% organic wastes accounted for the RCRs during the summer and winter seasons respectively. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) content of the food wastes employed in this study was evaluated to be 22.66 and the empirical equation generated was C27H44NO16. STATA 12 software and ANOVA statistical technique were used to evaluate the seasonal variation between the winter and summer seasons (spanning a space of six months). The p-values obtained for the DR was (p-value = 0.9775) and for the RCR, it was (p-value = 0.9760) at 95\% confidence level using STATA 12 tests. Similarly, the p-value obtained for the DR was (p-value = 0.999) and for the RCR, it was (p-value = 0.991) in turn using ANOVA tests at 95\% confidence level. Furthermore, Minitab software was used to forecast the trend of waste generation between 2016 and 2025. Based on the overall results, it was concluded that the differences between the wastes generated in both seasons were not statistically significant (p {\textquestiondown} 0.05). Furthermore, a total of 102,406 tonnes of wastes would be generated during the period under consideration (a period of ten years). This indicates a negative trend for CoJ in terms of waste generation. However, this trend can be mitigated through Zero waste (ZW) implementation.},

While many approaches and procedures have been proposed to assess usability in general, to date there is no standardized way to measure the overall usability of a PGIS. For this purpose, we introduce the Participatory GIS Usability Scale (PGUS), a questionnaire to evaluate the usability of a PGIS along five dimensions (user interface, spatial interface, learnability, effectiveness, and communication). The questionnaire was developed in collaboration with the user community of SeaSketch, a web-based platform for marine spatial planning. PGUS quantifies the subjective perception of usability on a scale between 0 and 100, facilitating the rapid evaluation and comparison between PGIS. As a case study, the PGUS was used to collect feedback from 175 SeaSketch users, highlighting the usability strengths and weaknesses of the platform.},

The engine combines (i) a new hydraulic solver based on the one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations and (ii) a Kalman filtering scheme that efficiently updates hydraulic states based on observed data. Using sensor data from a real-world watershed, we find that the simulation engine is effective at both interpolating hydraulic states and forecasting future states based on current measurements. By providing a complete, real-time view of system hydraulics, our software will enable rapid detection of flooding, improved characterization of maintenance and remediation needs, and robust real-time control for both small-scale (stormwater) and large-scale (river/reservoir) networks.},

Given the important role individuals can play in addressing climate change via their interpersonal communication, it is important to understand preferences for using or avoiding communication framed with negative emotions, and their ultimate impact on taking action to address climate change. Further, social expectations about the use of emotions may influence whether individuals' gender and political identity impacts their preference for using specific types of emotions. Three studies tested preferences for and impacts of three negative emotions common to climate change responses: fear, sadness, and anger, in comparison to messages framed without emotion. Findings indicate that people generally prefer messages framed without emotion, although in line with predictions, women, and Democrats are more apt to prefer emotional messages than men and Republicans. Although participants say they prefer messages framed without emotion, climate change messages framed with negative emotions are more likely than messages framed without emotion to match participants' feelings on climate change, while messages framed with specific types of negative emotions are more likely than messages framed without emotion to convey impressions of the speaker as rational, strong, and caring, which in turn predict greater preference for emotional over non-emotional messages. Further, results from a petition-signing study indicate that communicating with negative emotions does not promote nor hinder behavioral engagement.},

Residents were given the opportunity to visualize online the project area in 3D format, suggest their ideas, comment on the design proposal, produce interactive graphical designs online, and interact with each other. The impact of this process was tested according to five criteria (efficiency, feasibility, attractiveness, interaction, and satisfaction) developed via free-listing and pile-sorting methods in collaboration with nine experts. A qualitatively driven (QUAL) mixed method was used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 62 subjects, which included professionals and citizens. The results showed that the use of 3DDPP tools can potentially enhance community engagement in decision-making.

We outline a research agenda that we see as crucial for obtaining a solid evidence base on how emotions can optimally promote sustainable behavior.

The affective responses people experience toward climate change are consistently found to be among the strongest predictors of risk perceptions, mitigation behavior, adaptation behavior, policy support, and technology acceptance. As correlational results do not imply that inducing affective states will necessarily lead to the corresponding changes in a target population, research efforts now should focus on establishing the causal pathways from affect and emotion towards climate action. Communication and intervention studies show that inducing both positive and negative emotions may under certain conditions promote sustainable behavior, but the field would benefit from a stronger integration of concepts and findings from affective psychology. Explicitly considering the mechanisms by which emotions influence decisions and actions may help design more efficient affective interventions.}

Human annotated Twitter data was collected in the immediate aftermath of Rigby's murder to train and test a supervised machine learning text classifier that distinguishes between hateful and/or antagonistic responses with a focus on race, ethnicity, or religion; and more general responses. Classification features were derived from the content of each tweet, including grammatical dependencies between words to recognize "othering" phrases, incitement to respond with antagonistic action, and claims of well-founded or justified discrimination against social groups. The results of the classifier were optimal using a combination of probabilistic, rule-based, and spatial-based classifiers with a voted ensemble meta-classifier.

In order to achieve this, a Scale Of Solastalgia (SOS) was designed and then validated, by means of applying it to 223 inhabitants at the municipalities of Pencahue (n = 105) and Curepto (n = 118), who were also evaluated by the Short Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview (SPRINT-E). Using robust validation methods (Parallel factor analysis and Omega), two dimensions were obtained for solastalgia: solace and algia. Both correlate with the SPRINT-E scale (r = 0.150, p \&lt; 0.01 and r = 0.359, p \&lt; 0.01, respectively) and have 58\% sensitivity and 67\% specificity to detect cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Like PTSD, solastalgia is related to psychopathologies expected after disasters and also presents a spatial pattern where the concentration of positive cases occurs in places of greater exposure to environmental change or degradation.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

  abstract = {Behavioural scientists have been studying public perceptions to understand how and why people behave the way they do towards climate change. In recent times, enormous changes to behaviour and people's interactions have been brought about by the worldwide coronavirus pandemic (covid-19), unexpectedly and indefinitely; some of which have environmental implications (e.g., travelling less). An innovative way to analyze public perceptions and behaviour is with the use of social media to understand the discourse around climate change. This paper focuses on assessing changes in social media discourse around actions for climate change mitigation over time during the global pandemic. Twitter data was collected at three different points during the pandemic: February (time 1), June (time 2), and October 2020 (time 3). By using machine learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and unsupervised learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling, we identified tweets mentioning actions to mitigate climate change. The findings identified topics related to `Government actions', `Environmental behaviours', `Sustainable production', and `Awareness', among others. We found an increase in tweets identified as `action tweets' relating to climate change for time 2 and time 3 compared to time 1. In addition, we found that the topic of energy seemed to be of relevance within the public's perceptions of actions for climate change mitigation; this did not seem to change over time. We found that the topic of `Government actions', was present across all time points, and may have been influenced by political events at time 1, and by covid-19 discourse at times 2 and 3. Moreover, topic changes over time within Twitter indicated a pattern that may have reflected restrictions on mobility as these tended to focus on individual and private sphere, rather than group and public sphere, behaviours. Changes in topic patterns may also reflect an increase in salience of certain behaviours (e.g., shopping) which may have received increased attention due to lockdown restrictions. Considering restrictions and adaptability challenges people face in times of a global pandemic may help to identify how to support sustainable behaviour change, and the likely persistence of these changes.},

The contribution investigates the evolution of the DT concept and contextualises this tool within the scientific-cultural debate, highlighting the interconnection between global policies and local needs/wishes. Specifically, six case studies of DTs are compared, illustrating their application, content, technological infrastructure, and priority results. The projects presented provide an overview of the existing DT typologies, focusing on the evaluative/prefigurative use and the limits/potential of the tool in light of the socio-health, climate, and environmental crises. Reflections on DT reveal, on the one hand, its potential role in supporting decision-making and participatory processes and, on the other, the potential utopian trend of data-driven planning encouraged by public{\textendash}private investments in the smart city/twin city sector. In conclusion, the study underlines the innovative role of DT as a cutting-edge scientific format in the disciplinary framework but highlights that the practical use of the tool is still in an experimental research-action phase. From this theoretical-critical review, it is possible to hypothesise new research paths to implement the realism and application potential of DTs for urban planning and urban governance.},

This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities{\textemdash}assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

Hence, there is a need to develop an efficient system which can eliminate this problem or at least reduce it to the minimum level. In today's era, every government across the globe is planning to build smart cities or try to transform existing cities into smart cities. Collection of solid waste is a crucial point for environment and its impact on society should be considered seriously in smart cities infrastructure. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can efficiently handle such services in smart cities. In this paper, we are proposing an IoT based solid waste management system which enables garbage bin monitoring, dynamic scheduling and routing of garbage collector trucks in a smart city. In the proposed system, garbage bins equipped with low cost embedded device are located at various places in entire city. Real time status of garbage level along with garbage bin location is sent to cloud. We have designed a cloud based system for organizing solid waste management process and mobile application for waste collection drivers and Municipal Corporation to monitor and control solid waste collection as a service. Mobile application facilitates the waste collection drivers to go to the garbage bins using dynamic and shortest route.},

We first present the state of present research related to these notions and our interpretations. Then we present asystematic approach for rendering geographic data in a cartographic style based on the visual properties of Pop Art; the resulting maps are more vibrant and expressive. We consider this result a first step towards enhancing map quality. The proposition of a Pop Art cartographic style leads us to revisit some theoretical and practical principles of Semiology of Graphics (Bertin 1967), considering our experience with color contrasts and new approach for using texture. We conclude that expressive cartographic renderings would be useful for every mapmaker, and in the context of personalized map design, providing more elaborate tools could improve the design process and the resultant maps. Improving map quality is a question of managing visual variables in a traditional way{\textemdash}according to Bertin's Semiology of Graphics{\textemdash}but also in a more artistic way, in order to find better cartographic representation according to the preferences, needs, and purposes of the mapmaker.},

In Study 1, the scale was developed and validated in an MTurk sample of 197. Exploratory factor analysis of our item pool revealed a four-factor structure, with cognitive-emotional impairment, functional impairment, behavioral engagement, and experience emerging as unique factors. Cognitive-emotional impairment and functional impairment were considered to constitute subscales for climate change anxiety; along with behavioral engagement, they were all related to experience as well as to negative emotions. Neither climate change anxiety nor general depression and anxiety were related to behavioral engagement. Study 2 replicated the factor structure as well as the pattern of correlations in a second MTurk sample of 199. Study 3 examined the relationship between climate change anxiety and adaptation responses in a sample of 217, and tested whether climate change anxiety scores would be affected by the framing of a climate change message. Overall, results suggest that climate change anxiety is not uncommon, especially among younger adults; that worry can be differentiated from a more serious impact on one's life; and that climate change anxiety is correlated with emotional but not behavioral responses to climate change.},

The nature of environmental change in the Upper Hunter landscape over the past two centuries is first described, followed by the preliminary results of a long-term study that aims to investigate the nature of residents' understanding of, and responses to, environmental change. Data from in-depth interviews found that the transformation of the environment from mining and power station activities was associated with significant expressions of distress linked to negative changes to interviewees' sense of place, well-being, and control. A new concept, ``solastalgia,'' is introduced to help explain the relationship between ecosystem health, human health, and powerlessness. We claim that solastalgia, as opposed to nostalgia, is a type of homesickness (distress) that one gets when one is still ``at home.'' Future research will aim to validate a questionnaire to test the hypothesis that environmental distress is associated with levels of depression, quality of life, and rates of stress-related disease, as well as activism and environmental rehabilitation.},

'People-watching' is therefore critical. But capitalizing on social proof is tricky as long as concern outpaces action. Other recent research elegantly responds to this conundrum by advertising improvements in social norms, setting people up to find cause for hope even when action is low.

Hereafter, two human cases of autochthonous TBE have been reported, occurring in 2016. One case was geographically linked to the area of the previously reported ticks, which harbored a genetically divergent TBEV-Eu strain variant (TBEV-NL). So far these are the few reported events that point to endemic transmission of TBEV in the Netherlands and the true prevalence of TBEV and TBE disease in the Netherlands and its impact on the human population remains to be determined. We describe the third human case, identified in 2017, which geographically clusters with the aforementioned case and TBEV-positive ticks. We also describe the identification of another TBEV-NL-positive tick in the Netherlands, collected 2 years after the initial find in that same region (in 2017). These observations support the concept of continued circulation of TBEV-NL and the presence of a possible TBEV hot spot in the Sallandse Heuvelrug region.},

In general, cities are complex systems being a ``heterogeneous mosaic'' of a variety of cultures and functions, characterised by diverging perceptions and interests (ibid). The juxtaposed perceptions and interests in relation to ongoing spatial processes of change create a particularly complex situation. Thus, for planning processes we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with the urban complexity but also allow for participatory processes to empower citizens. This paper presents the approach of using Digital Twins in virtual reality (VR) for civic engagement in urban planning, enriched with quantitative and qualitative empirical data as one promising approach to tackle not only the complexity of cities but also involve citizens in the planning process.},

  abstract = {Cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and demographic conditions and change. They are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the ``Morgenstadt Werkstatt'' (Tomorrow's Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions.},

  abstract = {Emotions influence people's behavior in a profound way. Feelings like happiness, hope, fear, boredom, anger, anxiety or relaxation affect the way people behave and interact with one another. However, there is often a strong correlation between the environment and the way people feel, e.g., the emotions associated with a hospital are typically very different from those associated with an amusement park or a promenade. The aim of an emotion map is to represent and depict interrelationships between emotions and geographic locations. Such maps can provide answers to various questions about how people feel at various places or at different times of the day. They can facilitate a search for places where people express a certain emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new approach of creating emotion maps from a large collection of geotagged social-media posts. We discuss potential usages of such maps. We present a model to query and utilize emotion maps and we demonstrate creation of emotion maps by applying emotion analysis to millions of geotagged tweets.},

Our ability to visualize this type of information has rapidly improved with the proliferation of social media sites throughout the Internet in recent years. While many methods to extract information on human behavior from crowdsourced geodata already exist, this paper focuses on visualizing landscape perception for application to the fields of landscape and urban planning. Visualization of peoples' perceptual responses to landscape is demonstrated with crowdsourced photo geodata from Flickr, a popular photo sharing community. A basic, general method to map, visualize, and evaluate perception and perceptual values is proposed. The approach utilizes common tools for spatial knowledge discovery and builds on existing research, but is specifically designed for implementation within the context of landscape perception analysis and particularly suited as a base for further evaluation in multiple scenarios. To demonstrate the process in application, three novel types of visualizations are presented: the mapping of sightlines in Yosemite Valley, the assessment of landscape change in the area surrounding the High Line in Manhattan, and individual location analysis for Coit Tower in San Francisco. The results suggest that analyzing crowdsourced data may contribute to a more balanced assessment of the perceived landscape, which provides a basis for a better integration of public values into planning processes.},

My views over the past 40 years have changed radically from my initial view (Ekman, 1957) that: (a) a pleasantunpleasant and activepassive scale were sufficient to capture the differences among emotions; and (b) the relationship between a facial configuration and what it signified is socially learned and culturally variable. I was forced to adopt the opposite view by findings from my own and others crosscultural studies of facial expressions. There are some who have challenged this by now quite large body of evidence: I describe those challenges and the answers to them in Chapter 16. The framework I describe below is most influenced by Darwin (1872/1997) and Tomkins (1962), although I do not accept in total what either said. There are three meanings of the term basic (see also Ortony \& Turner, 1990). First, it distinguishes those who maintain that there are a number of separate emotions, that differ one from another in important ways. From this perspective, fear, anger, disgust, sadness and contempt, all negative emotions, differ in their appraisal, antecedent events, probable behavioral response, physiology and other characteristics described below. So, too, amusement, pride in achievement, satisfaction, relief and contentment, all positive emotions, differ from each other. This basic emotions perspective is in contrast to those who treat emotions as fundamentally the same, differing only in terms of intensity or pleasantness.}

However, such place-related understandings of mental health and wellbeing remain largely limited to Indigenous health contexts. In this article we argue the relevance of sense of place in understanding the mental health impacts of climate change on family farmers who retain close living and working relationships to the land. We conducted a community-based qualitative case study located in the Western Australian Wheatbelt - a region that has experienced some of the most significant climate change in Australia. A three-part interview series was conducted with 22 family farmers between February 2013 and April 2014, and 15 interviews with various agricultural and mental health key informants. The research findings reveal that recently observed patterns of climate change have exacerbated farmers' worries about the weather, undermined notions of self-identity, and contributed to cumulative and chronic forms of place-based distress, culminating in heightened perceived risk of depression and suicide. The research findings highlight the tightly coupled ecosystem health-human health relationships that exist for family farmers living in regions affected by climate change, as well as the significance of farmers' place-based attachments and identities for their mental health and wellbeing.},

By 2019, West Texas' Permian Basin accounted for 35\% of domestic oil production. We conducted an online survey of 566 Texans in 2019 to examine the implications of UOGD using three measures from the Environmental Distress Scale (EDS): perceived threat of environmental issues, felt impact of environmental change, and loss of solace when valued environments are transformed (``solastalgia''). We found increased levels of environmental distress among respondents living in counties in the Permian Basin who reported a 2.75\% increase in perceived threat of environmental issues (95\% CI = -1.14, 6.65) and a 4.21\% increase in solastalgia (95\% CI = 0.03, 8.40). In our subgroup analysis of women, we found higher EDS subscale scores among respondents in Permian Basin counties for perceived threat of environmental issues (4.08\%, 95\% CI = -0.12, 8.37) and solastalgia (7.09\%, 95\% CI = 2.44, 11.88). In analysis restricted to Permian Basin counties, we found exposure to at least one earthquake of magnitude {$\geq$} 3 was associated with increases in perceived threat of environmental issues (4.69\%, 95\% CI = 0.15, 9.23), and that county-level exposure to oil and gas injection wells was associated with increases in felt impact (4.38\%, 95\% CI = -1.77, 10.54) and solastalgia (4.06\%, 95\% CI = 3.02, 11.14). Our results indicate increased environmental distress in response to UOGD-related environmental degradation among Texans and highlight the importance of considering susceptible sub-groups.},

  abstract = {Tailpipe Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a Typical Passenger Vehicle T he U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed this fact sheet to answer common questions about greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. This fact sheet provides emission rates and calculations consistent with EPA's regulatory work. How much tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO 2) is created from burning one gallon of fuel? The amount of CO 2 created from burning one gallon of fuel depends on the amount of carbon in the fuel. Typically, more than 99\% of the carbon in a fuel is emitted as CO 2 when the fuel is burned. Very small amounts are emitted as hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, which are converted to CO 2 relatively quickly in the atmosphere. Carbon content varies by fuel, and some variation within each type of fuel is normal. EPA and other agencies use the following average carbon content values to estimate CO 2 emissions: CO 2 Emissions from a gallon of gasoline: 8,887 grams CO 2 /gallon 1 CO 2 Emissions from a gallon of diesel: 10,180 grams CO 2 /gallon 2 Diesel creates about 15\% more CO 2 per gallon. However, many vehicles that use diesel fuel achieve higher fuel economy than similar vehicles that use gasoline, which generally offsets the higher carbon content of diesel fuel. How can burning one gallon of gasoline produce 8,887 grams (approximately 20 pounds) of tailpipe carbon, when one gallon of gasoline weighs only about six pounds? Most of the weight of the CO 2 doesn't come from the gasoline itself, but the oxygen in the air. When gasoline burns, the carbon and hydrogen separate. The hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H 2 O), and carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO 2). Visit fueleconomy.gov for more details, including the calculations. 1 This gasoline factor is from a regulation establishing GHG standards for model year 2017-2025 vehicles (77 FR 62773, October 15, 2012). 2 This diesel factor is from the calculations that vehicle manufacturers use to measure fuel economy (40 C.F.R 600.113).},

Even different studies exist in the literature for the route optimization of conventional fuels-based garbage trucks as mentioned above, no studies devote to considering the electric garbage trucks to the best of our knowledge. Besides, it is not easy to reach the detailed garbage collection area information in the literature. In this manner, data have been obtained by real field measurements in a region within the service area of Bakirkoy Municipality, Istanbul, Turkey. A unit energy consumption value that can be considered as a reference in the future has also been obtained using real data. Besides, real road information data have been integrated to the data used as input while assessing the optimization approach and the system analyses have been conducted in a more realistic concept. The proposed concept has led to an increased reality of nearly 38\% for the analysis of the results under conditions closer to real-time, and a decrement of nearly 32\% has been obtained.

Modern traceability devices, like volumetric sensors, identification RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and GPS (Global Positioning System) technology, permit to obtain data in real time, which is fundamental to implement an efficient and innovative waste collection routing model.The basic idea is that knowing the real time data of each vehicle and the real time replenishment level at each bin makes it possible to decide, in function of the waste generation pattern, what bin should be emptied and what should not, optimizing different aspects like the total covered distance, the necessary number of vehicles and the environmental impact.This paper describes a framework about the traceability technology available in the optimization of solid waste collection, and introduces an innovative vehicle routing model integrated with the real time traceability data, starting the application in an Italian city of about 100,000 inhabitants. The model is tested and validated using simulation and an economical feasibility study is reported at the end of the paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The marchers protested the election of President Donald Trump and rallied in support of several civil issues such as women's rights. ``Sister marches'' evolved in at least 680 locations across the United States. Both positive and negative reactions to the March found their way into social media, with criticism stemming from certain, conservative, political sources and other groups. In this study, we investigate the extent to which this notable, historic event influenced sentiment on Twitter, and the degree to which responses differed by geographic area within the continental U.S. Tweets about the event rose to an impressive peak of over 12\% of all geo-located tweets by mid-day of the March, Jan. 21. Messages included in tweets associated with the March tended to be positive in sentiment, on average, with a mean of 0.34 and a median of 0.07 on a scale of -4 to +4. In fact, tweets associated with the March were more positive than all other geo-located tweets during the day of the March. Exceptions to this pattern of positive sentiment occurred only in seven metropolitan areas, most of which involved very small numbers of tweets. Little evidence surfaced of extensive patterns of negative, aggressive messages towards the event in this set of tweets. Given the widespread nature of online harassment and sexist tweets, more generally, the results are notable. In sum, online reactions to the March on this social media platform suggest that this modern arm of the Women's Movement received considerable, virtual support across the country.},

Given the speed and scale of climate change alongside biodiversity loss, pollution, deforestation, unbridled resource extraction, and other environmental challenges, more and more people will experience solastalgia. This study reviewed 15 years of scholarly literature on solastalgia using a scoping review process. Our goal was to advance conceptual clarity, synthesize the literature, and identify priorities for future research. Four specific questions guided the review process: (1) How is solastalgia conceptualized and applied in the literature?; (2) How is solastalgia experienced and measured in the literature?; (3) How is 'place' understood in the solastalgia literature?; and (4) Does the current body of literature on solastalgia engage with Indigenous worldviews and experiences? Overall, we find there is a need for additional research employing diverse methodologies, across a greater diversity of people and places, and conducted in collaboration with affected populations and potential knowledge, alongside greater attention to the practical implications and applications of solastalgia research. We also call for continued efforts to advance conceptual clarity and theoretical foundations. Key outcomes of this study include our use of the landscape construct in relation to solastalgia and a call to better understand Indigenous peoples' lived experiences of landscape transformation and degradation in the context of historical traumas.},

  abstract = {Background: Tick populations and tick-borne infections have steadily increased since the mid-1990s posing an ever-increasing risk to public health. Yet, modelling tick dynamics remains challenging because of the lack of data and knowledge on this complex phenomenon. Here we present an approach to model and map tick dynamics using volunteered data. This approach is illustrated with 9 years of data collected by a group of trained volunteers who sampled active questing ticks (AQT) on a monthly basis and for 15 locations in the Netherlands. We aimed at finding the main environmental drivers of AQT at multiple time-scales, and to devise daily AQT maps at the national level for 2014. Method: Tick dynamics is a complex ecological problem driven by biotic (e.g. pathogens, wildlife, humans) and abiotic (e.g. weather, landscape) factors. We enriched the volunteered AQT collection with six types of weather variables (aggregated at 11 temporal scales), three types of satellite-derived vegetation indices, land cover, and mast years. Then, we applied a feature engineering process to derive a set of 101 features to characterize the conditions that yielded a particular count of AQT on a date and location. To devise models predicting the AQT, we use a time-aware Random Forest regression method, which is suitable to find non-linear relationships in complex ecological problems, and provides an estimation of the most important features to predict the AQT. Results: We trained a model capable of fitting AQT with reduced statistical metrics. The multi-temporal study on the feature importance indicates that variables linked to water levels in the atmosphere (i.e. evapotranspiration, relative humidity) consistently showed a higher explanatory power than previous works using temperature. As a product of this study, we are able of mapping daily tick dynamics at the national level. Conclusions: This study paves the way towards the design of new applications in the fields of environmental research, nature management, and public health. It also illustrates how Citizen Science initiatives produce geospatial data collections that can support scientific analysis, thus enabling the monitoring of complex environmental phenomena.},

  abstract = {The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns.},

When changes are abrupt and drastic, they can negatively impact people who had become attached to a landscape's prior character. Place-based models of landscape change assert that the strength of people's attachments can influence their experience of and response to change. We apply a qualitative deductive-inductive approach to examine rapid change experienced by family forest owners in the northern Great Lakes region of the U.S. (N = 17), whose densely forested property was in the path of a major windstorm and near an ongoing pine barrens restoration. Through in-depth interviews we found that landowners had a strong sense of place for the Northwoods, a culturally-constructed landscape character of big trees and continuous canopy of relatively recent origin in our study area. This sense of place acted as a lens through which they experienced multiple and sometimes cumulative drivers of change resulting in a spectrum of losses, including solastalgia. Sense of place affected how they responded to change on their own property, with most wanting to assist or let ``Mother Nature take its course'' in returning the land to its Northwoods character rather than its more open, ecologically-based conditions. Responses to the pine barrens restoration ranged from negative to somewhat positive, with those expressing positive feelings mentioning aesthetic, ecological, and functional reasons. Implications for management and place-based model development are discussed.},

By partnering the scholarship outlined above with advances in research on conspiracy ideation, we argue that climate change skepticism and denial is, at least in some cases, a form of an exaggerated ostrich effect, whereby adherents are so driven to avoid learning about a specific problem; they actively seek to construct an alternative, safer, narrative. Given this predisposition, attempting to challenge such skepticism with information is counterproductive.

  abstract = {Emotions about climate change are the subject of a growing area of interdisciplinary scholarship. But so far scholars have not studied the emotions expressed by self-declared climate change skeptics; nor have social scientists turned to affect studies to develop nuanced understandings of the constellation of emotions related to fear. Our team conducted 33 interviews and 1000 surveys with self-identified skeptics living in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The data demonstrates the variability in perspectives, ideologies, and behaviors among skeptics themselves in new and unique ways, including tracking skeptics' emotions about climate change. This article focuses on worry and dread. We find that those who believe climate change is a hoax, and skeptics who are politically conservative, tend to express less of these two emotions, as do men who identify as skeptics. Religiosity, as measured by frequency of religious attendance, does not significantly correlate with worry and dread; however, specific religious beliefs related to climate change (e.g. ``Climate change is punishment for our sins'') do seem to increase those two feelings. Negative firsthand environmental experiences are also associated with higher degrees of worry and dread. Perhaps most significantly, our data suggests that worry and dread correlate strongly with environmental concern and policy support. Our interdisciplinary approach has several methodological advantages. First, affect studies encourages more nuance in emotion language, including more detailed definitions of emotions like worry and dread, which simmer over time, as opposed to discrete emotions like fear, which are shorter-lived. Second, sociological approaches remind us that emotions function within particular political, historical, and cultural contexts, which are fundamentally shaped by power structures. Finally, humanities scholars can provide useful input both in research design and the interpretation of results by helping craft survey questions and data codes, and by providing close attention to the language of the survey and interview responses. Combined with quantitative data, this multi-pronged methodology brings together forms of knowledge from the humanities and social sciences. Our approach serves as a model for new work in the growing field of empirical ecocriticism and expands the boundaries of the environmental humanities.},

  abstract = {A dynamic digital twin is a feasible solution that can be employed to build real-time con-nectivity between virtual and physical objects. Industries like manufacturing, aerospace and healthcare utilise dynamic digital twins for simulation, monitoring and control purposes, but recently, this nascent technology has also attracted the interest of urban designers. Due to the novelty of the dynamic digital twin in urban design, this research study addresses the concept of digital twin technology and investigates its applicability in so-called smart city settings. Drawing on results from research interviews and examples from the Digital Twin project in Helsinki city, the research illustrates that solid data infrastructure forms the foundation for urban digital twins and the development of future smart city applications and services. Furthermore, data-enriched digital twins evidently accelerate smart city ex-perimentations and strengthen both learning and knowledge-based decision-making. Digital twins have also proved that they offer an environment in which smart city practitioners can bridge multi-stakeholder urban design teams through one digital platform. K E Y W O R D S Digital twin, smart city, smart city experimentation, stakeholders 1 | INTRODUCTION Globally, cities benefit from advanced digital technologies upgrading city infrastructures and functions and also building new digital services that can facilitate the lives of citizens. With nascent digital technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), cities aim to optimise their daily functions (e.g. traffic and energy consumption). Alternatively, by investing in digital technologies (surveillance cameras and sensor technologies), cities aim to also strengthen city security and enhance the overall monitoring and governance of cities. Moreover, with novel digital technologies, cities aim to syn-chronise city processes and attract citizens to participate in urban development projects and activities. By doing so, cities pursue making city operations more transparent and less bureaucratic for the citizens [1-6]. Considering climate change and environmental impacts, cities have a salient role when adopting and carrying out sustainability initiatives. According to [7]; cities globally are responsible for over 75 percent of the world{\textasciiacute}s energy and material flows and consumption. It is emphasised that understanding cities{\'u}rban metabolism (the production, import and export of diverse natural and non-renewable material flows like water, energy, food and waste in the urban area) is fundamental when developing more sustainable cities and communities [8-10]. By exploiting smart city technologies, including dynamic digital twins, cities may enhance the design and planning of urban metabolism and improve possibilities to simulate alternative solutions in a virtual environment before final implementation. Novel digital solutions thus assist cities in optimising urban metabolism and find solutions with which to achieve the climate change and sustainability objectives set for the cities. Following the development of computer-aided design (CAD), urban designers have utilised digital three-dimensional (3D) modelling to construct static 3D city models of the built environment and also to bring content to digital city models. Static 3D city models have allowed urban developers to visu-alise and analyse city plans and allowed urban developers to communicate the plans more easily to other city developers [11, 12]. However, recently the evolution of digital technologies , the emergence of sensors and the IoT have taken virtual 3D modelling to the next level. Following examples from reference industries, such as mechanical engineering and aerospace, designers implement sensor technologies to form connectivity between a static 3D model and its real-world This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.}

Human-induced climate change is one of this century's greatest unbalancing forces to have affected our planet. Capturing the public awareness of climate change on Twitter has proven to be significant. In a previous research, it was demonstrated by the authors that public awareness is prominently expressed in the form of hashtags that uses more than one bigram (i.e. a climate change term). The research finding showed that this awareness is expressed by more complex terms (e.g. "climate change"). It was learned that the awareness was dominantly expressed using the hashtag: \#ClimateChange. Design/methodology/approach'The methods demonstrated here use objective computational approaches [i.e. Google's ranking algorithm and Information Retrieval measures (e.g. TFIDF)] to detect and rank the emerging events. Findings'The results shows a clear significant evidence for the events signaled using emergent hashtags and how globally influential they are. The research detected the Earth Day, 2015, which was signaled using the hashtag \#EarthDay. Clearly, this is a day that is globally observed by the worldwide population. Originality/value'It was proven that these computational methods eliminate the subjectivity errors associated with humans and provide inexpensive solution for event detection on Twitter. Indeed, the approach used here can also be applicable to other types of event detections, beyond climate change, and surely applicable to other social media platforms that support the use of hashtags (e.g. Facebook). The paper explains, in great detail, the methods and all the numerous events detected.},

Discussion and conclusion: The authors argue the following three points: firstly, while attribution of mental health outcomes to specific climate change risks remains challenging, there are a number of opportunities available to advance the field of mental health and climate change with more empirical research in this domain; secondly, the risks and impacts of climate change on mental health are already rapidly accelerating, resulting in a number of direct, indirect, and overarching effects that disproportionally affect those who are most marginalized; and, thirdly, interventions to address climate change and mental health need to be coordinated and rooted in active hope in order to tackle the problem in a holistic manner. This discussion paper concludes with recommendations for priority actions to address the mental health consequences of climate change.},

In this study, optimized scenarios were developed using the ArcGIS Network Analyst tool in order to improve the efficiency of waste collection and transportation in the cities of Irbid, Karak and Mafraq, Jordan. Geographic Information System (GIS) has been created based on data collection involving GPS tracking (collection route/bin position). Both key performance and key operational costs indicators of the actual state (Scenario S0) were evaluated, and by modifying particular parameters, other scenarios were generated and analyzed to identify optimal routes: S1, route optimized with the same working resources and method as in S0 (change of the daily working hours per shift only); S2, route optimized with a change of collection mode with the same daily working time per shift as in S0 (change the transportation equipment and relocate and/or introduce new transfer stations); and S3, route optimized using a combination of S1 \&amp; S2 (change of the daily working hours per shift and collection mode). The results showed that the three scenarios guarantee savings compared to S0 in terms of the total cost of waste collection of 15, 13 and 23\% for S1, S2 and S3 respectively in the city of Irbid, 6, 3 and 8\% for S1, S2 and S3 respectively in the city of Karak, and 11, 6 and 13\% for S1, S2 and S3, respectively in the city of Mafraq. Thus, a direct impact on vehicle operating times can be expected with savings of 30\%, without mentioning the additional benefits related to CO2 emissions, hours of work, vehicle wear/maintenance, and so forth.},

The findings support the literature that the benefits of using a 2D or 3D model are closely related to the types of planning tasks undertaken. The findings also reveal a complex view of planning activities, suggesting that planners themselves cannot be treated as a single group for research purposes.},

Therefore, it may not optimize the costs of distribution. Manual optimization cannot be used if the number is locations is more than five because the solution space is too big to solve by hand. Pigeon Inspired Optimization (PIO) is proposed as a heuristic method for optimizing the VRP to optimize the cost and then it will be compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method as comparison algorithm. Evaluation was conducted by comparing their performance in optimizing cost for several solution spaces. The achieved result is the shortest distribution path according to the constraints given and has lowest total cost of distribution. It can be concluded that PIO is better for optimizing the goods distribution path so that the distribution cost becomes minimal.},

  abstract = {Background: Climate change has important implications for the health and futures of children and young people, yet they have little power to limit its harm, making them vulnerable to climate anxiety. This is the first large-scale investigation of climate anxiety in children and young people globally and its relationship with perceived government response. Methods: We surveyed 10 000 children and young people (aged 16{\textendash}25 years) in ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA; 1000 participants per country). Invitations to complete the survey were sent via the platform Kantar between May 18 and June 7, 2021. Data were collected on participants' thoughts and feelings about climate change, and government responses to climate change. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each aspect of climate anxiety, and Pearson's correlation analysis was done to evaluate whether climate-related distress, functioning, and negative beliefs about climate change were linked to thoughts and feelings about government response. Findings: Respondents across all countries were worried about climate change (59\% were very or extremely worried and 84\% were at least moderately worried). More than 50\% reported each of the following emotions: sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. More than 45\% of respondents said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning, and many reported a high number of negative thoughts about climate change (eg, 75\% said that they think the future is frightening and 83\% said that they think people have failed to take care of the planet). Respondents rated governmental responses to climate change negatively and reported greater feelings of betrayal than of reassurance. Climate anxiety and distress were correlated with perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal. Interpretation: Climate anxiety and dissatisfaction with government responses are widespread in children and young people in countries across the world and impact their daily functioning. A perceived failure by governments to respond to the climate crisis is associated with increased distress. There is an urgent need for further research into the emotional impact of climate change on children and young people and for governments to validate their distress by taking urgent action on climate change.

  abstract = {The study aimed to validate the Environmental Distress Scale (EDS), a new index of the bio-psycho-social cost of ecosystem disturbance. Informed by qualitative fieldwork in the open-cut mining area of Australia's Upper Hunter Valley, the EDS combines dimensions of hazard perception, threat appraisal, felt impact of changes, "solastalgia" (loss of solace), and environmental action. EDS discriminant validity was tested by randomly mailing the instrument to Upper Hunter residents living in a high disturbance open-cut mining area and to a comparable sample in a nearby farming area; 203 respondents returned the survey (41\% response rate). As predicted, the high disturbance group had significantly higher environmental distress scores across all six EDS subscales, including solastalgia. Psychometric analyses found the EDS subscales were highly intercorrelated (r = 0.36-0.83), and they demonstrated both strong internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79-0.96) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.67-0.73). Descriptively, the high disturbance group experienced greater exposure to dust, landscape changes, vibrations, loss of flora and fauna, and building damage, as well as greater fear of asthma and other physical illnesses due to local pollution. The EDS successfully measured and validated Albrecht's innovative concept of "solastalgia"-the sense of distress people experience when valued environments are negatively transformed. While the EDS addresses the power and mining industries, it can be adapted as a general tool to appraise the distress arising from people's lived experience of the desolation of their home and environment. Ideally, it can be used as an aid for those working to ameliorate that distress and restore ecosystem health. {\textcopyright} 2006 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.},

This study proposes a methodology for routing collection vehicles in the twin cities (i.e. Islamabad and Rawalpindi) of Pakistan. In particular, the study's application-based vehicle routing problem (VRP) accommodates a variety of practical rules such as zone constraints, vehicle capacities, time windows, road infrastructure, and commodity type. As a pilot study, eleven routes were selected in different areas of the twin cities to minimize the length of the routes and consequently the time taken to complete the collection. Results indicate that travel distance was reduced by up to 18\% in Islamabad and 9\% in Rawalpindi. The collection time was also reduced from 7.5 h to 5.8 h and 8.3 h{\textendash}7.2 h for Islamabad and Rawalpindi, respectively. Our research provides a decision support tool for municipal administrators for efficient management of the daily operations of solid waste management. Other spatial data can be added in the future to enhance the utility of our model, such as generation of capacity for various residential areas, types of dumping vehicles, and enhanced road network operations.},

In this paper, we report incidence estimates for GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009, and we compare the observed increase in GP consultations to reports of tick bites in two retrospective cross-sectional surveys of the general population. Methods: All GPs in the Netherlands were asked to complete a postal questionnaire on the number of consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses in 2009, and the size of their practice populations. To investigate how the incidence of GP consultation rates for tick bites and erythema migrans relate to the incidence of tick bites in the general population, questionnaire data on tick bites were analyzed from two large population surveys conducted to evaluate the national immunization program in 1995/1996 and 2006/2007. Results: The 2009 GP survey revealed a further increase, to 564 tick bite consultations per 100,000 inhabitants, and 134 erythema migrans diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands. The two population surveys from 1995/1996 and 2006/2007 exhibited an almost twofold increase of the incidence of tick bites in the general population from 4099 per 100,000 population in 1996, to 7198 per 100,000 population in 2007. People nationwide noticed approximately 1.1 million tick bites in 2007. Conclusions: Our observation of increases in GP consultations for tick bites and erythema migrans diagnoses between 1994 and 2009 are confirmed by the parallel increase of tick bites reported by the general population, although consultation rates slightly increased. For every sixty tick bites in the general population in 2007, we observed one GP consult for erythema migrans. The increase in tick bites poses a progressive threat to public health.},

Design/methodology/approach {\textendash} The data set consists of about 250,000 tweets and retweets for which the authors' gender was identified. While content of tweets and hashtags used were analysed for common topics and specific contexts, the usernames that were proportionately more frequently mentioned by either male or female tweeters were coded according to the usernames' stance in the climate change debate into convinced (that climate change is caused by humans), sceptics, neutrals and unclear groups, and according to the type or role of the user account (e.g. campaign, organization, private person). Findings {\textendash} The results indicate that overall male and female tweeters use very similar language in their tweets, but clear differences were observed in the use of hashtags and usernames, with female tweeters mentioning significantly more campaigns and organizations with a convinced attitude towards anthropogenic impact on climate change, while male tweeters mention significantly more private persons and usernames with a sceptical stance. The differences were even greater when retweets and duplicate tweets by the same author were removed from the data, indicating how retweeting can significantly influence the results. Practical implications {\textendash} On a theoretical level the results increase the understanding for how women and men view and engage with climate change. This has practical implications for organizations interested in developing communication strategies for reaching and engaging female and male audiences on Twitter. While female tweeters can be targeted via local campaigns and news media, male tweeters seem to follow more political and scientific information. The results from the present research also showed that more research about the meaning of retweeting is needed, as the authors have shown how retweets can have a significant impact on the results. Originality/value {\textendash} The findings contribute towards increased understanding of both gender differences in the climate change debate and in social media use in general. Beyond that this research showed how retweeting may have a significant impact on research where tweets are used as a data source.},

Despite this urgency, CO2 emissions (and global temperatures) continue to climb. Progress on mitigating climate change is slowed by the stubborn persistence of climate skepticism, as well as a failure for nonskeptics to translate their concern about climate change into meaningful action. The goal of this article is to describe and synthesize research on how to understand (and reduce) this public inaction on climate change. In the first half of the article, we examine the question of how to understand (and overcome) climate change skepticism. We review international evidence regarding the role of demographics, ideologies, and conspiracist worldviews in shaping people's willingness to believe in the reality of human-caused climate change. We then review theory and research on how to successfully capture the attention of{\textemdash}and change the behavior of{\textemdash}people who traditionally resist climate change messages, such as those high in conservatism and free-market beliefs. In the second half of the article, we examine how to promote more climate-friendly behaviors among people who believe in the reality of climate change. Evidence will be reviewed suggesting that many people agree that climate change is caused by humans, but are not yet willing to make the necessary investments and sacrifices to respond to this threat. We then draw on relevant literatures to critically discuss three strategies for promoting proenvironmental behavior: (i) optimistic versus pessimistic messages; (ii) in-group versus out-group messenger effects; and (c) the use of descriptive and injunctive norms.}

This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible.},

One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.},

The traditional approach utilizing IoT-based techniques for data collection and transmission for waste management applications is not energy-efficient and currently infeasible for such LS-WSNs, thus necessitating the need for a transformation to an IoV-based technique, where vehicular networks can be opportunistically exploited for efficient data collection for waste management strategies in SCs. This paper gives two contributions to research in waste management for SCs. First, a comprehensive study of the various IoT-based techniques for waste management in SCs is presented. Survey studies present energy consumption of the sensor-nodes due to high routing/transmission/control overheads as a major challenge. Several IoT-based techniques have been used to optimize the energy efficiency of the sensor-nodes. However, none has effectively addressed the challenges of energy consumption and optimization. The second contribution proposes an IoV-based technique for data collection for waste management in SCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such a proposed scheme for SC waste management strategies. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to propose a novel IoV-based model for SC waste management strategies. This technique involves the use of vehicles as opportunistic MDCs to optimize energy efficiency. The paper also proposes using swarm-intelligence-based methods to increase energy efficiency and data collection for SC waste management application. An energy-efficient routing model is very critical to IoT-based applications. Hence, the paper presents an energy-efficient opportunistic model utilizing the ant-based routing algorithms for LS-WSN SC waste management applications. The paper also provides some analytical approaches to determine the energy consumption of the network model. The final part presents experiments in different application scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results present the proposed approach in good performance in terms of the performance metrics compared to the conventional techniques for waste management strategies.},

Due to the relevance of smart cities (also referred using other related terms such as Digital City, Information City, Intelligent City, Knowledge-based City, Ubiquitous City, Wired City) to various stakeholders and the benefits and challenges associated with its implementation, the concept of smart cities has attracted significant attention from researchers within multiple fields, including information systems. This study provides a valuable synthesis of the relevant literature by analysing and discussing the key findings from existing research on issues related to smart cities from an Information Systems perspective. The research analysed and discussed in this study focuses on number of aspects of smart cities: smart mobility, smart living, smart environment, smart citizens, smart government, and smart architecture as well as related technologies and concepts. The discussion also focusses on the alignment of smart cities with the UN sustainable development goals. This comprehensive review offers critical insight to the key underlying research themes within smart cities, highlighting the limitations of current developments and potential future directions.},

Australian residents (N = 333) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: one framed to increase psychological distance to climate change (distal frame), and the other framed to reduce psychological distance (proximal frame). Participants then completed measures of psychological distance of climate change impacts, climate change concern, and intentions to engage in mitigation behavior. Principal components analysis indicated that psychological distance to climate change was best conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four components: geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty. Path analysis revealed the effect of the treatment frame on climate change concern and intentions was fully mediated by psychological distance dimensions related to uncertainty and social distance. Our results suggest that climate communications framed to reduce psychological distance represent a promising strategy for increasing public engagement with climate change.},

Furthermore, municipal vehicles have great environmental impact through exhaust gases emissions. The aim of this research was to estimate the potential for reduction of fuel consumption and thus the emission of CO2 through the communal vehicles route optimization. General methodology for route optimization is also presented. For the area under study, detailed field experimental research in the City of Kragujevac was conducted. Using GIS and GPS technology, whole municipally infrastructure for waste collection was scanned and all paths of communal tracks was recorded and allocated in developed database. Based on experimental and numerical results, one typical municipal vehicle route was analyzed by using ArcGis software. The obtained result indicates 2700 km of possible savings per year concerning one communal vehicle. In addition, the most fuel-economical route was extracted and compared with the original route, and with the routes extracted from criterions concerning the traffic time and shortest distance. According to available information for the City of Kragujevac and the results from this study, it was estimated that the total savings could be 20\% in costs and the associated emissions.]]{\textquestiondown}{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}},

This model is part of an extended solid waste management system and uses a spatial Geodatabase, integrated in a GIS environment. It takes into consideration several parameters of waste generation, such as population density, commercial activities, road characteristics and their influence on the location and allocation of waste bins. Ground-based analysis was applied for the estimation of the inter-relations between the aforementioned factors and the variations in waste generation between residential and commercial areas. Therefore, the proposed model follows a unified categorization approach for residential and commercial activities and focuses on the dominant factors that determine waste generation in the area under study. The most important result of the research work presented in the current paper is an accurate estimation of the optimal number of waste bins and their allocation. A new methodology and an appropriate algorithm have been developed for this purpose in order to facilitate routing and waste collection. By using these results, municipalities aware of social, economical and environmental factors, related to waste management, can achieve optimal usage of their resources and offer the best possible services to their citizens.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}},

Advances in deep learning and scalable cloud-based compute now provide the analysis capability required to unlock the value in global satellite imagery observations. Based on a novel, very large dataset of over 5 billion human-labeled Sentinel-2 pixels, we developed and deployed a deep learning segmentation model on Sentinel-2 data to create a global LULC map at 10m resolution that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables automated LULC mapping from time series observations.},

As a result, the city becomes unclean, the environment becomes contaminated, and the atmosphere becomes unsanitary. It distributes a foul odor in the waste, which may be harmful to our human health. To avoid this problem, keep the environment clean and create a healthy environment. The ultrasonic sensor detects the amount of trash in the trash can. We created a low-cost embedded device for city sanitation that allows the web server to track the location of each street. It's simple to tell whether a dustbin is full or not. As soon as the level hits a certain maximum pre-setted limit, automatically the information is sent to the bin collector.

  abstract = {I n 2018, the World Bank published What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050. Based on municipal waste generation data from 217 countries and economies, the report estimated that global waste generation was set to increase by 70\% from 2016 to 2050, driven by increases in prosperity and urbanization. This projection is more than double the population growth estimates for the same period. With 93\% of waste in low-income countries currently being openly dumped and burned, the world faces a looming waste crisis that threatens to impose substantial environmental, social, and financial costs on our societies. More Growth, Less Garbage presents an updated picture of how waste generation could grow if the world continues along the current trajectory and how to consider changing that path toward lower waste levels. Historically there has been a correlation between waste generation and income per capita. This publication explores the possibility of decoupling waste generation, and thus consumption, from economic growth. Five case studies of waste reduction, in terms of residual waste and/or total waste, are highlighted from cities and countries across the world. In each location, decisions to reduce or divert waste were driven by a different factor, such as lack of land, the need to be more resilient, or the need to reduce costs of the overall waste system. Based on these stories, scenarios were developed to estimate potential changes to the current business-as-usual trajectory, which estimates waste generation to grow from 2.24 billion tonnes in 2020 to 3.88 billion tonnes by 2050. If waste reduction policies were adopted in more places around the world, we could envisage a world in 2050 with more growth and less garbage than today.},

Quantifying an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) is important for promoting solid waste management and disposal. However, there is still lack of a review of the application of CVM in the field of environmental science. This study provides a systematic review of the application of CVM in solid waste management and disposal, to understand the research status and future development, and to identify the key influence factors on an individual's WTP values. Most studies have focused on five kinds of typical solid waste (construction and demolition waste, e-waste, agricultural waste, plastic waste, and municipal solid waste) and on solid waste management service. In designing the CVM questionnaire, the sample size, elicitation technology (e.g., double-bounded dichotomous choice), and survey method (e.g., face-to-face interview) were considered, to improve the CVM reliability. The results indicate that personal information (especially educational level, age, and income level), individual attitudes and perceived behavioral control were often the significant factors for residents' WTP. This study also discloses the distribution of existing studies (mainly focused on Asia) and development from the perspective of spatial and temporal distribution (diversification of research subjects), analyzes the urban-rural disparities and discusses the correlation between WTP/WTP values and regions with different economic levels. The study provides scholars with suggested questionnaire design methods and experiences, and provides policymakers with breakthrough points for improving solid waste management, through which a zero-waste city development model can be better constructed.},

  abstract = {The construct of psychological distance has gained traction as an explanation of why climate change is difficult to act on; it often feels far removed, with impacts arising in remote locations to other people or in an uncertain future. However, recent studies and narrative reviews have pointed out inconsistencies in the conceptualisation, operationalisation and results regarding the psychological distance of climate change, with research evidently struggling to develop the construct and determine its place in explaining and promoting pro-environmental behaviour. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature aimed at building an evidence base on which to develop research on psychological distance. Following a systematic search of three databases, 73 records with 84 individual studies were identified, which measured or manipulated the concept in relation to climate change. We find that psychological distance in the context of climate change is a dynamic, context-specific, multidimensional construct, with a wide variety of approaches to measurement and manipulation. Current theorising (primarily Construal Level Theory) is insufficient in describing the diversity and complexity of distance in the climate-change context. Based on the reviewed studies, we give recommendations for the measurement and manipulation of the construct. However, our overarching suggestion is to focus on specific contexts in which distance plays a role in climate-change cognition and action, such as the perception of impacts, policy or behaviour. We discuss how describing distance within these contexts can help researchers to understand current findings, to disentangle different components of distance beliefs and to incorporate theory and insights from related perspectives.},

At the same time, the world is rapidly urbanizing. These changes place a burden on cities to manage garbage appropriately on both a social and environmental level. Globally, extensive research has been conducted to develop a comprehensive MSW management system that includes treatment. The primary objective of this article is to examine municipal solid waste in eight of China's eastern coastal regions. With the use of this review, we found that MSW generation is increasing in Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, but declining in other eastern coastal cities, provinces, and special zones. Furthermore, municipal solid waste in China is treated utilizing 52 percent landfill, 45 percent incineration, and 3 percent composting techniques, resulting in significantly lower usage efficiency than in developed countries. The effectiveness of China's municipal waste management system must be improved. In addition, this review examines MSW management issues and prospects in China, as well as recommendations for strengthening the MSW management system.},

This inspired the notion of using Twitter users as distributed sensors, which has been successfully employed in both the natural and social sciences. In 2012 and 2013, we collected 1.8 million tweets on "climate change" and "global warming" in five major languages (English, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish). We discuss the geography of tweeting, weekly and daily patterns, major news events that affected tweeting on climate change, changes in the central topics of discussion over time, the most authoritative traditional media, blogging, and the most authoritative organizational sources of information on climate change referenced by Twitter users in different countries.

  abstract = {While smart cities have the potential to monitor and control the city in real-time through sensors and actuators, there is still an important road ahead to evolve from isolated smart city experiments to real large-scale deployments. Important research questions remain on how and which wireless technologies should be setup for connecting the city, how the data should be analysed and how the acceptance by users of applications can be assessed. In this paper we present the City of Things testbed, which is a smart city testbed located in the city of Antwerp, Belgium to address these questions. It allows the setup and validation of new smart city experiments both at a technology and user level. City of Things consists of a multi-wireless technology network infrastructure, the capacity to easily perform data experiments on top and a living lab approach to validate the experiments. In comparison to other smart city testbeds, City of Things consists of an integrated approach, allowing experimentation on three different layers: networks, data and living lab while supporting a wide range of wireless technologies. We give an overview of the City of Things architecture, explain how researchers can perform smart city experiments and illustrate this by a case study on air quality.},

The 2nd main task is to apply an analysis of appraisal patterns and the core relational themes that they produce to a number of commonly identified emotions. Anger, anxiety, sadness, and pride (to include 1 positive emotion) are used as illustrations. The purpose is to show the capability of a cognitive-motivational-relational theory to explain and predict the emotions.

  abstract = {Background: Youth are increasingly aware of the negative effects of climate change on the planet and human health, but this knowledge can often come with significant affective responses, such as psychological distress, anger, or despair. Experiencing major ``negative'' emotions, like worry, guilt, and hopelessness in anticipation of climate change has been identified with the term eco-anxiety. Emerging literature focuses on adults' experience; however, little is known about the ways in which children and youth experience eco-anxiety. Objectives: The aim of this review was to: (1) identify the available evidence on the topic of eco-anxiety in children, (2) clarify the mental health consequences brought by the awareness of climate change in this population, and (3) identify knowledge gaps in the literature and considerations for future research. Methods: Given that the research on the topic of eco-anxiety in children is limited, that there are very few randomized controlled trials, and that the goal is not to analyze individual studies in-depth, a scoping review was used. Keywords pertaining to the themes of eco-anxiety, climate change and children (aged {\textexclamdown} 18 years) were used as search terms in five databases. Journal articles using qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as gray literature were examined by two independent reviewers. A descriptive-analytical method was used to chart the data that emerged from the literature. Eighteen articles were considered in the final analysis. Results: Evidence confirms that children experience affective responses and eco-anxiety in reaction to then awareness of climate change. Mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, and extreme emotions like sadness, anger, and fear. Youth from vulnerable communities, like indigenous communities, or those who have strong ties to the land are often identified as being emotionally impacted by climate change. The literature analyzed also describes how children and youth are coping with eco-anxiety, including maladaptive (e.g., denial) and adaptive responses (such as constructive hope, used as a positive coping mechanism). Preliminary considerations for parents, teachers and educators, mental health care providers, school systems, adults and people of power include adding age-appropriate climate education to the school curriculum, considering youth's emotions, and promoting healthy coping through empowerment. Important gaps exist in the definition of eco-anxiety in youth, as various characterizations of this emerging concept are found across articles.},

This study systematically reviews the potential influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical waste, personal protection equipment waste and municipal solid waste (MSW), and discusses the corresponding measures and policies of solid waste management in typical countries. The results show that the generation of medical waste from the pandemic increased significantly, with 18\%{\textendash}425\% growth. It is estimated that the daily output of COVID-19 medical waste increased from 200 t/d on Feb. 22 to over 29000 t/d at the end of September 2020 throughout the world. The use of personal protective equipment will continue to grow in the long-term, while the blockade and isolation measures greatly reduced the volume of commercial waste, especially for tourist cities, and part of this waste was transferred to household waste. Residents' attitudes and behavior toward food waste have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, international organizations and several countries have issued new policies and guidelines and adjusted their management strategies for medical waste and MSW treatment. The pandemic has brought specific challenges to the disposal capacity of medical waste worldwide. It has also brought about the stagnation of policies related to the reduction of plastic products and waste recycling. This study will provide some useful information for managers and governmental officials on effective solid waste management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Appropriate solid waste management systems are important for improving the environment and the well being of residents. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for real time waste monitoring and collection has been proposed; able to improve and optimize solid waste collection in a city. Netlogo Multiagent platform has been used to simulate real time monitoring and smart decisions on waste management. Waste filling level in bins and truck collection process are abstracted to a multiagent model and citizen are involved by paying the price for waste collection services. Furthermore, waste level data are updated and recorded continuously and are provided to decision algorithms to determine the vehicle optimal route for waste collection to the distributed bins in the city. Several simulation cases executed and results validated. The presented solution gives substantial benefits to all waste stakeholders by enabling the waste collection process to be more efficient.},

However, further investigation is required to identify interdependencies among different stakeholders and improve their interactions within the system. This research took Xiamen, a Chinese city, as a case study, which was one of 8 Chinese pilot cities that implemented waste separation in 2000 and one of the 46 key cities participating in a new separation policy since 2017. We used stakeholder analysis (SA), social network analysis (SNA) and ecological network analysis (ENA) to identify the characteristics of different stakeholders, their network structure, and the beneficiaries and contributors to the urban waste separation management (UWSM) system. The research conducted a comparison of resident's participation before and after the new waste separation policy, as well as a comparison among different stakeholders in the new policy. The results showed that all stakeholders had a high level of satisfaction in 2017, but that satisfaction levels decreased with distance from the downtown area. Residents were more willing to participate in waste separation in 2017 than in 2012. Based on their powers and interests, stakeholders were divided into 4 categories that had different network centrality. The ecological relationships between stakeholders were mainly exploitative and competitive which may cause potential inefficiency; powerful stakeholders did not benefit the whole system and the least powerful stakeholder was the largest contributor. The combined application of these methods were complementary to help diagnose information flow problems in the socio-ecological system. Policy implications to further promote mutualism in UWSM are discussed.},

We find that messages in the U.K. related to climate change are less negative than in Spain; whereas the most evoked feeling in the U.K. (Spain) is anticipation (fear). However, our results show quite similar views about preferences for energy policies in these two Western European countries. In particular, renewable sources of energy are associated with positive perceptions, and coal with negative; whereas heteregoneous preferences are present in the case of nuclear energy. Information of this type may be relevant in order to understand public reactions and preferences towards mitigation and adaptation policies across countries. Our results complement and correspond quite well with those previously published in European surveys.

We then review the voluminous literature that documents the intragroup and intergroup cognitive and behavioral outcomes driven by such emotions. We next review the theoretically and practically crucial notion of how such emotions are regulated, a topic that has been an increasing research focus in the last 5 years. The chapter ends with a description and discussion of intergroup emotion-relevant interventions that have been or could be designed to improve intergroup relations.},

The scores of DOAQ were compared with the smart cities scorings from Eden Strategy Institute and ONG\&ONG Pte Ltd. (2018), and other socioeconomic attributes (i.e., social, political and humane) within the current study. Strong correlations (i.e., 0.4-0.6) among these indices implicate that the status of air quality reporting could be a good proxy to gauge the environmental data openness in a city. Lastly, good practices (e.g., apps and air quality forecasts), essential criteria and directions for future smart city development on air quality reporting were summarized, with the aim of laying down practical and efficient guidelines for individual smart city that desires to seek for improvements in air quality data openness.},

This literature has examined conflicts over waste, particularly in the context of privatization and state initiatives that seek to more systematically and legibly capture waste's value. These conflicts suggest that, perhaps ironically, there is not enough valuable waste for all those willing to work to reclaim it. In this paper, we argue that there remains ambiguity over fundamental questions around the meaning of `rights' to material resources in conditions of scarcity. Here, we do not seek to determine who ought to have access, but instead look to an empirical case to understand ongoing practices and permissions that enable access to waste. We asked those who work in the informal waste sector about who is ultimately given permission to access this value, and how such permissions are framed, demanded, enacted, infringed upon and contested. We also looked to see how well words mapped onto actions, and what happened when conflicts arose. In this context, we report a series of `guidelines' that the waste pickers in our research used to establish, negotiate and contest claims to access waste among those who work informally in the sector and with others who see its value. We conclude by considering the implications of thinking of waste as a limited resource and of the ongoing construction and negotiation of permissions, rather than rights, to take materials in the city.},

More precisely, two state-of-the-art object detectors based on deep learning techniques have been selected for testing, according to their performance and to their adaptability to an on-board real-time environment: EfficientDet and YOLOv5. Experimental results indicate that the proposed visual model for waste container detection is able to effectively operate with consistent performance disregarding the container type (organic waste, plastic, glass and paper recycling,{\ldots}) and the city layout, which has been assessed by evaluating it on eleven different Spanish cities that vary in terms of size, climate, urban layout and containers' appearance.},

Fifty-One pickup nodes were strategically placed in Mmabatho Unit 3 and 6 areas of the Mafikeng local municipal area where the refuse is collected once a week. Significant results were reached with an optimal route generated.},

To date, the study of emotion and persuasion has been largely defined by research on fear appeals (e.g., Leventhal, 1970; Witte, 1994). Although other approaches to affective influence have certainly been given their due, such as the effect of mood on social judgments (e.g., Forgas, 1991; Isen, 1987, 1993; Schwarz, Bless, \& Bohner, 1991) and the role of emotional blends in advertising outcomes (e.g., Christ \& Thorson, 1992; Holbrook \& Batra, 1987), overlooked have been the persuasive effects of discrete emotions other than fear, such as anger, sadness, envy, and joy. Because of their unique adaptive functions, discrete emotions likely have particular implications for the process and direction of persuasive influence as well as appropriate application contexts, thus necessitating consideration of their persuasive impacts as separate phenomena, both from other approaches and from one another. This chapter, then, has three objectives. First, it lays out the functional emotion perspective from which the notion of discrete emotions is derived. Second, it reviews the current state of our knowledge regarding the pervasive effects of several discrete negative emotions (fear, guilt, anger, sadness, disgust, and envy) and positive emotions (happiness/ j oy, pride, relief, hope, and compassion) in mediated contexts, interpreted from emotion's functional perspective. Finally, given our limited understanding of the persuasive role of most discrete emotions, the chapter concludes by considering the theoretical perspectives and questions that may effectively guide future research in this area.},

Studying the adaptation to these phenomena requires taking into account the coping strategies (problem-focused or emotional-focused coping) implemented by the inhabitants of the exposed territories. A theoretical model of situational and dispositional factors determining these strategies has been proposed and tested empirically with 583 inhabitants of the island of Guadeloupe, which is exposed to said coastal flooding risk. The fit index confirms the adequacy of the model. The results indicate that coastal flooding risk perception, difficulties to regulate emotions, and place attachment predict avoidance coping. Vigilant coping is only predicted by perceived action efficiency. The roles of duration of residence and distance from the sea have been highlighted.},

In most of the urban areas, disposal sites are usually located outside of the urban areas due to the scarcity of land. There is no fixed route map for transportation. The current waste collection and transportation are already overloaded arising from the lack of facilities and insufficient resources. In this paper, a model for optimizing municipal solid waste collection will be proposed. Firstly, the optimized plan is developed in a static context, and then it is integrated into a dynamic context using multi-agent based modelling and simulation. A case study related to Hagiang City, Vietnam, is presented to show the efficiency of the proposed model. From the optimized results, it has been found that the cost of the MSW collection is reduced by 11.3\%.},

Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.

In contrast to existing studies that focus on the public's lack of information or concern about global warming as the basis for the lack of public response, my work describes the way in which holding information at a distance was an active strategy performed by individuals as part of emotion management. Following Evitar Zerabavel, I describe this process of collective avoiding as the social organization of denial. Emotions played a key role in denial, providing much of the reason why people preferred to avoid information. Emotion management was also a central aspect of the process of denial, which in this community was carried out through the use of a cultural stock of social narratives that were invoked to achieve "perspectival selectivity" and "selective interpretation." {\textcopyright} 2006 Alpha Kappa Delta.}

This paper develops an approach that integrates scientific knowledge and stakeholders' demands to provide decision-making guidelines for the development of new landscape planning strategies while considering ecosystem services. First, a participatory process was conducted to develop a community vision for the region's sustainable future considering the opportunities and constrains provided by the landscape and its ecosystems. In the participatory process forest management was considered an important driver for the region`s landscape development and forest multi-functionality was envisioned as a feasible attractive alternative. The participatory process identified a knowledge gap on the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and how these depend on different forest types. Second, to study the existing synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and disentangle the identified knowledge gap, a GIS-based research was conducted based on spatially explicit indicators. Our spatial analysis results showed that natural forests' contribution to biodiversity and carbon storage is higher than that of the plantations with exotic species in the region. The results from the spatial analysis converged with those from the participatory process in the suitability of promoting, where possible and appropriate, natural forest ecosystems restoration. This iterative learning and decision making process is already showing its effectiveness for decision making, with concrete examples of how the results obtained with the applied approach are being included in planning and decision-making processes.},

  abstract = {The continued increase in average and extreme temperatures around the globe is expected to strike urban communities more harshly because of the urban heat island (UHI). Devising natural and design-based solutions to stem the rising heat has become an important urban planning issue. Recent studies have examined the impacts of 2D/3D urban land-use structures on land surface temperature (LST), but with little attention to the shades cast by 3D objects, such as buildings and trees. It is, however, known that shades are particularly relevant for controlling summertime temperatures. This study examines the role of urban shades created by trees and buildings, focusing on the effects of shade extent and location on LST mitigation. A realistic 3D digital representation of urban and suburban landscapes, combined with detailed 2D land cover information, is developed. Shadows projected on horizontal and vertical surfaces are obtained through GIS analysis, and then quantified as independent variables explaining LST variations over grids of varying sizes with spatial regression models. The estimation results show that the shades on different 3D surfaces, including building rooftops, sun-facing fa{\c c}ades, not-sun-facing fa{\c c}ades, and on 2D surfaces including roadways, other paved covers, and grass, have cooling effects of varying impact, showing that shades clearly modify the thermal effects of urban built-up surfaces. Tree canopy volume has distinct effects on LST via evapotranspiration. One of the estimated models is used, after validation, to simulate the LST impacts of neighborhood scenarios involving additional greening. The findings illustrate how urban planners can use the proposed methodology to design 3D land-use solutions for effective heat mitigation.},

Using statistical methods, tweets were analyzed to discover the hashtags used when people tweeted about the IPCC report, and how Twitter users formed communities around their conversational connections. In short, the paper presents the topics and tweeters at this particular moment in the climate debate. The most used hashtags related to themes of science, geographical location and social issues connected to climate change. Particularly noteworthy were tweets connected to Australian politics, US politics, geoengineering and fracking. Three communities of Twitter users were identified. Researcher coding of Twitter users showed how these varied according to geographical location and whether users were supportive, unsupportive or neutral in their tweets about the IPCC. Overall, users were most likely to converse with users holding similar views. However, qualitative analysis suggested the emergence of a community of Twitter users, predominantly based in the UK, where greater interaction between contrasting views took place. This analysis also illustrated the presence of a campaign by the non-governmental organization Avaaz, aimed at increasing media coverage of the IPCC report.},

Some commentators suggest that this is having profound effects across society, that social media have opened up new channels for public debates and have revolutionized the communication of prominent public issues such as climate change. In this article we provide the first systematic and critical review of the literature on social media and climate change. We highlight three key findings from the literature: a substantial bias toward Twitter studies, the prevalent approaches to researching climate change on social media (publics, themes, and professional communication), and important empirical findings (the use of mainstream information sources, discussions of ``settled science,'' polarization, and responses to temperature anomalies). Following this, we identify gaps in the existing literature that should be addressed by future research: namely, researchers should consider qualitative studies, visual communication and alternative social media platforms to Twitter. We conclude by arguing for further research that goes beyond a focus on science communication to a deeper examination of how publics imagine climate change and its future role in social life.

There are two prominent explanations for this motivational gap in the climate ethics literature. The first maintains that our conventional moral judgement system is not well equipped to identify a complex problem such as climate change as an important moral problem. The second explanation refers to people's reluctance to change their behaviour and the temptation to shirk responsibility. We argue that both factors are at play in the motivational gap and that they are complemented by crucial moral psychological insights regarding moral disengagement, which enables emitters to dissociate self-condemnation from harmful conduct. In this way, emitters are able to maintain their profligate, consumptive lifestyle, even though this conflicts with their moral standards with respect to climate change. We provide some illustrations of how strategies of moral disengagement are deployed in climate change and discuss the relationship between the explanations for the motivational gap and moral disengagement. On the basis of this explanatory framework, we submit that there are three pathways to tackle the motivational gap and moral disengagement in climate change: making climate change more salient to emitters and affirming their self-efficacy; reconsidering the self-interested motives that necessitate moral disengagement; and tackling moral disengagement directly.},

Since the term PSS appeared for the first time in the late 1980s it has evolved into a serious academic subfield. In this debate, little systematic attention has been paid to the added value of PSS for planning practice. In particular the perspective of users requires more empirical attention. This paper attempts to fill this gap by answering the question: What is the practitioner's perception of the added value of PSS? In doing so we first develop a conceptual framework including the most important added values of PSS observed in the literature. Next, we describe an empirical study of the MapTable PSS, a support tool that is relatively frequently used in the Netherlands. Fifteen interviews were conducted and a Group Decision Room workshop was organized in order to systematically gather perceptions of users about the added value of this PSS. Added values that particularly emphasized are improved collaboration and communication among stakeholders, something which resonates with recent trends in planning. The added value of a better informed outcome is, somewhat surprisingly, considered less important. In order to deepen our understanding, we recommend more research in different contexts and with different tools. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The frequency of short duration, high-intensity rainfall is expected to increase in the future due to climate change. Given the limited capacity of drainage systems in South Asian cities, urban flooding and waterlogging is expected to intensify. The problem gets worse when low-lying areas are filled up for infrastructure development due to unplanned urban growth, reducing permeable areas. Additionally, solid waste, when dumped in canals and open spaces, blocks urban drainage systems and worsens urban flooding and waterlogging. Using hydraulic models for two South Asian cities, Sylhet (in Bangladesh) and Bharatpur (in Nepal), we find that 22.3\% of the land area in Sylhet and 12.7\% in Bharatpur is under flooding risk, under the current scenario. The flood risk area can be reduced to 3.6\% in Sylhet and 5.5\% in Bharatpur with structural interventions in the drainage system. However, the area under flood risk could increase to 18.5\% in Sylhet and 7.6\% in Bharatpur in five years if the cities' solid waste is not managed properly, suggesting that the structural solution alone, without proper solid waste management, is almost ineffective in reducing the long-term flooding risk in these cities.},

Results indicate that solastalgia, resulting from loss of place, is experienced by almost half of residents, especially those who have lived in the area {\textquestiondown}20 years. Seasonal variation exists for residents who experience the highest levels of solastalgia, with expression strongest in summer.

Place attachment is most weakly expressed through place dependence, suggesting ongoing adaptation of relationships with place. We find that solastalgia is positively correlated with negative statements regarding future outlook. However, negative outlooks are moderated for those with high levels of place attachment, despite experiencing solastalgia. Given the vulnerability of coastal environments and communities to climate change, understanding and assessing solastalgia will be critical to helping communities navigate environmental disruption.},

However, there is a lack of research about the definitions and variations of these phenomena. This article analyzes various views of eco-anxiety from a wide range of disciplines. Insights from various anxiety theories are used to discuss empirical studies about forms of eco-anxiety. The article points out that uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability seem to be important factors in eco-anxiety. Most forms of eco-anxiety appear to be non-clinical, but cases of \&ldquo;pathological\&rdquo; eco-anxiety are also discussed. Other relevant terms and phenomena are scrutinized, such as ecological grief, solastalgia, and ecological trauma. The relationship between studies on eco-anxiety and research about ecological emotions and affect is probed. Eco-anxiety is found to be closely connected to fear and worry, but several disciplines include discussion of its character as existential anxiety. Psychosocial and sociological perspectives point out that social dynamics shape forms of eco-anxiety in profound ways. While paralyzing forms of eco-anxiety emerge as a problem, it is noted that eco-anxiety manifests itself also as \&ldquo;practical anxiety\&rdquo;, which leads to gathering of new information and reassessment of behavior options. This variety of forms of eco-anxiety should be taken into account in healthcare and public discussion.},

Climate emotions are related to resilience, climate action, and psychological well-being and health. However, there is currently a lack of research about the array of various climate emotions. There is also a need for more integration with general research about emotions. This article conducts a preliminary exploration of the taxonomy of climate emotions, based on literature reviews and philosophical discussion. The term emotion is used here in a broad sense, as is common in climate emotion research. Because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the lack of previous research, this kind of exploration is aimed to be helpful for both practical climate work and for future research which would include more systematic reviews of the topic. Research items which discuss at least five different climate emotions, based on empirical observations, are used as major sources and a table about them is provided. Climate emotions are discussed on the basis of interdisciplinary research. The article considers many aspects of the phenomena of climate anxiety and climate grief.},

The problem of illegal dumping is not unique to this municipality; it has also been identified in other municipalities in South Africa and in most parts of the world. The aim of the study was to assess the factors associated with the prevalence of dumping in Zondi Township, CoJ, South Africa. Semi structured questionnaires were used to interview the sampled respondents and the dumping spots were observed. A review if Integrated Development Plan (IDP) found no dumping prevention strategies in almost all the municipalities in the country. In order to find a solution for this problem, the root causes of this phenomenon should be clearly identified and understood. The results clearly highlight that lack of or irregular waste removal was the main driver of occurrence of illegal dumping. Therefore it is recommended that the CoJ improves waste removal services in order to curb waste illegal dumping.},

This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km2. We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems (forest zone) to be 13.1 million km2 or 23.5\% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3\%) and Boreal Forests (43.8\%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8\% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9\% has some form of protection, but only 9.7\% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data. All project results and IFL maps are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).},

This difficult combinatorial problem contains both the Bin Packing Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as special cases and conceptually lies at the intersection of these two well-studied problems. The capacity constraints of the integer programming formulation of this routing model provide the link between the underlying routing and packing structures. We describe a decomposition-based separation methodology for the capacity constraints that takes advantage of our ability to solve small instances of the TSP efficiently. Specifically, when standard procedures fail to separate a candidate point, we attempt to decompose it into a convex combination of TSP tours; if successful, the tours present in this decomposition are examined for violated capacity constraints; if not, the Farkas Theorem provides a hyperplane separating the point from the TSP polytope. We present some extensions of this basic concept and a general framework within which it can be applied to other combinatorial models. Computational results are given for an implementation within the parallel branch, cut, and price framework SYMPHONY.},

To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.}

Therefore, there is a need for a real-time remote monitoring system that alerts the level of garbage in the trash bins to the municipality or a waste management company. To manage the municipal solid waste efficiently, this article presents the development and validation of a self-powered, LoRaWAN Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled trash bin level monitoring system. The end nodes of the proposed IoT system are called trash bin level measurement unit (TBLMU) and are installed in each trash bin where the status needs to be monitored. The TBLMU measures the unfilled level and geographical location of a trash bin, processes the data, and transmits it to a LoRaWAN gateway at a frequency of 915 MHz. A LoRaWAN gateway serves as a concentrator for the TBLMUs and relays data between a TBLMU and an IoT trash bin level monitoring server. The users can view and analyze the status of every bin and its geolocation by using a smart graphical user interface. The accuracy of the developed system, wireless range between a TBLMU and a LoRaWAN gateway, average current consumption and life expectancy of the TBLMU, battery charging time, and the cost were studied and are reported here.},

  abstract = {The impacts of climate change-related events on mental health and emotional wellbeing have gained increased attention in recent years. However, research exploring how climate mitigation action, i.e., moving toward more sustainable lifestyles, interrelates with mental health is arguably a more hidden body of work. This research is scattered across fields and uses a variety of concepts to explore both the role that emotional and mental health management skills may play in enabling personal climate mitigation actions, as well as the ways in which accelerated transitions toward lower carbon emitting ways of life may impact on mental wellbeing at both an individual and societal level. Our systematic review therefore aims to bring together for the first time research which has been undertaken in the emerging area of mental health and climate mitigation action. To facilitate this exploration, systematic Web of Science searches were undertaken which: (1) identified 165 publications exploring climate change and mental health issues broadly, and (2) identified 26 publications relating climate mitigation actions with specific mental health impacts (anxiety, trauma, suicide, OCD). We find that mental health is primarily being seen as an outcome of climate change impacts, not a factor in our ability to work to avoid them. The limited work which does exist around mental health and climate mitigation action focusses on anxiety and trauma and spans the psychological, psychosocial, public health and wider social sciences. Anxiety and trauma-avoidance has been found to both stimulate and stifle action in different circumstances. One explanation may be the role organizations (and other social structures like family or gender identities) play in maintaining cultures which either support social defenses against mitigation action or provide emotionally-safe spaces for building climate commitment. Anticipating potential mental health impacts during policy planning{\textemdash}and putting in place appropriate support measures{\textemdash}will be vital to successfully meeting climate targets. We therefore conclude with implications for policy and practice, including the need to: build appropriate psychological support into behavior change interventions, work with groups who can provide each other with emotional peer support, and ensure health and social care professionals are given adequate training.},

The study identifies a combination of complementary instruments required for extending collection to all and bringing disposal under control. While municipalities have a legal responsibility for providing services to their citizens, various service providers can contribute to an effective SWM system. Appropriate forms of funding are essential to secure financial sustainability of the services under the local conditions of affordability and willingness to pay. As new services require behavioural change on the part of citizens and municipal waste departments alike, communication and exchange with other stakeholders function as enabling and supporting factors. The significance of capacity development is highlighted.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the potential role that emotions might play in enticing a lifestyle that diminishes climate change. Climate change is an important challenge for society. There is a growing consensus that climate change is due to our behavior, but few people are willing to significantly adapt their lifestyle. Empirical studies show that people lack a sense of urgency: they experience climate change as a problem that affects people in distant places and in a far future. Several scholars have claimed that emotions might be a necessary tool in communication about climate change. This article sketches a theoretical framework that supports this hypothesis, drawing on insights from the ethics of risk and the philosophy of emotions. It has been shown by various scholars that emotions are important determinants in risk perception. However, emotions are generally considered to be irrational states and are hence excluded from communication and political decision making about risky technologies and climate change, or they are used instrumentally to create support for a position. However, the literature on the ethics of risk shows that the dominant, technocratic approach to risk misses the normative-ethical dimension that is inherent to decisions about acceptable risk. Emotion research shows that emotions are necessary for practical and moral decision making. These insights can be applied to communication about climate change. Emotions are necessary for understanding the moral impact of the risks of climate change, and they also paradigmatically provide for motivation. Emotions might be the missing link in effective communication about climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

Original field testing and evaluation of the application were carried out in Pudong, Shanghai (PR China). The local waste management system in Pudong features particular requirements related to the rapidly increasing rate of waste production. In view of the fact that collected waste is currently deployed to landfills or to incineration plants within the context investigated, the key aspects to be taken into account in waste collection procedures include monitoring of the overall amount of waste produced, quantitative measurement of the waste present at each collection point and identification of classes of material present in the collected waste. The case study described herein focuses particularly on the above mentioned aspects, proposing the implementation of a network of sensorized waste containers linked to a data management system. Containers used were equipped with a set of sensors mounted onto standard waste bins. The design, implementation and validation procedures applied are subsequently described. The main aim to be achieved by data collection and evaluation was to provide for feasibility analysis of the final device. Data pertaining to the content of waste containers, sampled and processed by means of devices validated on two purpose-designed prototypes, were therefore uploaded to a central monitoring server using GPRS connection. The data monitoring and management modules are integrated into an existing application used by local municipal authorities. A field test campaign was performed in the Pudong area. The system was evaluated in terms of real data flow from the network nodes (containers) as well as in terms of optimization functions, such as collection vehicle routing and scheduling. The most important outcomes obtained were related to calculations of waste weight and volume. The latter data were subsequently used as parameters for the routing optimization of collection trucks and material density evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In Karbala the solid waste collection from the different regions, transfer and transport to the sanitary landfills are carried out by Municipality of Karbala. During the field survey it is noticed that the solid waste collection and transferring are accomplished by old manners and there is no program for solid waste management concerning the routs of the collection vehicles to achieve an efficient collection.

The area under study constitutes of three districts in Karbala, namely, [Shohadaa AL-Molhaq and Dhobat AL-Usra]. These three distrctis are selected for their variety in activities (residential areas, hospital, laboratories, restaurant, etc.,). The field survey is executed for the area under study and the length of main and branch streets are determined. Moreover, the quantity Of solid waste generated daily is defined according to the collection vehicles load, taking the population density and the activity nature into consideration. Three plans for the districts in the area under study are prepared. These plans show the streets and nodes which represent the intersection points. Each street is defined by two nodes (start and end nodes) and the quantity of solid wastes generated from each street, is distributed to represent the load (flow) at start and end notes. All this information is used as input data for QSB program which treats these data mathematically to find three different solutions. Each solution represents a suggested rout for collection vehicles according to certain objective function.}

  abstract = {Existing scientific concepts of group or shared or collective emotion fail to appreciate several elements of collectivity in such emotions. Moreover, the idea of shared emotions is threatened by the individualism of emotions that comes in three forms: ontological, epistemological, and physical. The problem is whether or not we can provide a plausible account of straightforwardly shared emotions without compromising our intuitions about the individualism of emotions. I discuss two philosophical accounts of shared emotions that explain the collectivity of emotions in terms of their intentional structure: Margaret Gilbert's plural subject account, and Hans Bernhard Schmid's phenomenological account. I argue that Gilbert's view fails because it relegates affective experience into a contingent role in emotions and because a joint commitment to feel amounts to the creation of a feeling rule rather than to an emotion. The problems with Schmid's view are twofold: first, a phenomenological fusion of feelings is not necessary for shared emotions and second, Schmid is not sensitive enough to different forms of shared concerns. I then outline my own typology that distinguishes between weakly, moderately, and strongly shared emotions on the basis of the participants shared concerns of different degree of collectivity, on the one hand, and the synchronization of their emotional responses, on the other hand. All kind of shared emotions in my typology are consistent with the individualism of emotions, while the question about straightforward sharing is argued to be of secondary importance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Using computational and conceptual text analysis, we examined more than 6,000 English-language posts on Twitter to establish the relative presence of different topics. Then, we assessed their levels of toxicity and sentiment polarity as an indication of contention and controversy. We find first that meat consumption and dietary options became one of the most discussed issues on Twitter in response to the IPCC report, even though it was a relatively minor element of the report; second, this new issue of controversy (meat and diet) had similar, high levels of toxicity to strongly contentious issues in previous IPCC reports (skepticism about climate science and the credibility of the IPCC). We suggest that this is in part a reflection of increasingly polarized narratives about meat and diet found in other areas of public discussion and of a movement away from criticism of climate science towards criticism of climate solutions. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of these findings for the work of the IPCC in anticipating responses to its reports and responding to them effectively.},

The authors conducted five online experiments examining the impact of affective ads about global warming on proenvironmental behaviors. They find that sadness-inducing videos lead to more time devoted to an energy-footprint calculator and greater donations to an environmental organization than nonaffective videos. However, once emotions have cooled off after a delay, there are no differences in induced behavior between affective and nonaffective messages. Warning people that emotions, and their effects on behavior, cool off does not reverse the effects of the time delay unless people make a nonbinding commitment just after watching the affective ad. These results help to explain why emotion-evoking ads designed to promote proenvironmental behaviors, such as cutting energy use, often fail to produce sustained behavior change, and they suggest that those who seek to promote a sustained response may need to elicit behavioral commitments in moments of high emotion.},

Waste management in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada is relatively unique and energy and emission-intensive in terms of infrastructure, accessibility, data unavailability, arctic climate, funding limitations, etc. To bridge the evident gap in literature on waste characteristics and management in the Northern and remote communities, this study closely examines the current practices of waste management, assesses the quantity and characteristics of waste generated through theoretical estimation, analyses the flow of waste through the existing system, and proposes an alternative system that focuses on material recovery. The potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both the current and proposed alternative system are also estimated to understand the environmental impacts. The average annual waste generation and disposal in NWT is nearly 0.66 tonne/capita/year (T/cap/y) and 0.62 T/cap/y, respectively. It is observed that increased waste diversion through composting and recycling can reduce the GHG emissions in NWT by 22,703 CO2e. With the estimated physico-chemical and thermal characteristics of wastes in NWT, this article serves as a knowledge base for decision-makers and policy analyses for developing a sustainable waste management paradigm, especially in isolated areas like NWT with extreme cold climate.},

Given the existing stakeholder knowledge base and the fact that practitioners mostly focus on the engagement of high-power and salience stakeholders, the interests of low-power and vulnerable stakeholders are often manipulated. Therefore, this research is devoted to the engagement of low-power and vulnerable stakeholders. Grounded in the stakeholder theory and the results of two illustrations, we demonstrate how the physical proximity of vulnerable stakeholders influences salience patterns in a multi-stakeholder engagement context. The contribution of the study is the conceptualisation of proximity as a stakeholder attribute, in addition to power, legitimacy, and urgency, to help managers identify and appropriately engage with vulnerable stakeholders. Thus, we extend stakeholder typologies by incorporating proximity into the existing attribute model. The proposed model addresses the paradoxical nature of stakeholder salience and engagement theories and furthers the sustainability agenda.},

Sentiment analysis has been a popular subject and there has been a plethora of research conducted in this area in recent decades, typically on social media platforms such as Twitter, due to the proliferation of data generated today during discussions on climate change. However, there is not much research on the performances of different sentiment analysis approaches using lexicon, machine learning and hybrid methods, particularly within this domain-specific sentiment. This study aims to find the most effective sentiment analysis approach for climate change tweets and related domains by performing a comparative evaluation of various sentiment analysis approaches. In this context, seven lexicon-based approaches were used, namely SentiWordNet, TextBlob, VADER, SentiStrength, Hu and Liu, MPQA, and WKWSCI. Meanwhile, three machine learning classifiers were used, namely Support Vector Machine, Na\&iuml;ve Bayes, and Logistic Regression, by using two feature extraction techniques, which were Bag-of-Words and TF\&ndash;IDF. Next, the hybridization between lexicon-based and machine learning-based approaches was performed. The results indicate that the hybrid method outperformed the other two approaches, with hybrid TextBlob and Logistic Regression achieving an F1-score of 75.3\%; thus, this has been chosen as the most effective approach. This study also found that lemmatization improved the accuracy of machine learning and hybrid approaches by 1.6\%. Meanwhile, the TF\&ndash;IDF feature extraction technique was slightly better than BoW by increasing the accuracy of the Logistic Regression classifier by 0.6\%. However, TF\&ndash;IDF and BoW had an identical effect on SVM and NB. Future works will include investigating the suitability of deep learning approaches toward this domain-specific sentiment on social media platforms.},

The solid waste of dumpsite contains various complex characteristics with organic fractions of the highest proportions. As leachate percolates into the soil, it migrates contaminants into the soil and affects soil stability and strength. The study includes the geotechnical investigation of dump soil characteristics and its comparison with the natural soil samples taken from outside the proximity of dumpsites. The geochemical analysis of dumpsite soil samples was also carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Visual inspection revealed that the MSW consists of high fraction of organics, followed by paper. The soil samples were collected from five trial pits in the dumpsites at depths of 0.5 m, 1 m and 1.5 m. Then the collected soil samples were subjected to specific gravity test, grain size analysis, Atterberg's limit test, compaction test, direct shear test, California bearing ratio (CBR) test and permeability analysis. The study indicated that the dumpsite soils from four study regions show decreasing trends in the values of maximum dry density (MDD), specific gravity, cohesion and CBR, and increasing permeability as compared to the natural soil. The results show that the geotechnical properties of the soils at all four study locations have been severely hampered due to contamination induced by open dumping of waste.},

This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.},

Among these systems, the Municipal Solid Waste Management System (MSWMS) is also affected. Waste collection and transportation is the first task in an MSWMS, carried out traditionally in most cases. This approach leads to inefficient resource and time expense since routes are prescheduled or defined upon drivers\&rsquo; choices. The waste collection is recognized as an NP-hard problem that can be modeled as a Capacitated Waste Collection Problem (CWCP). Despite the good quality of works currently available in the literature, the execution time of algorithms is often forgotten, and faster algorithms are required to increase the feasibility of the solutions found. In this paper, we show the performance of the open-source Google OR-Tools to solve the CWCP in Bragan\&ccedil;a, Portugal (inland city). The three metaheuristics available in this tool were able to reduce significantly the cost associated with waste collection in less than 2 s of execution time. The result obtained in this work proves the applicability of the OR-Tools to be explored for waste collection problems considering bigger systems. Furthermore, the fast response can be useful for developing new platforms for dynamic vehicle routing problems that represent scenarios closer to the real one. We anticipate the proven efficacy of OR-Tools to solve CWCP as the starting point of developments toward applying optimization algorithms to solve real and dynamic problems.},

This study also shows the connection between emotions and coping, expanding the crisis communication literature in public relations, and suggests the need to consider agenda-setting and resilience in crisis communication research. Finally, we discuss this study's implications for assuming a dialogic orientation in public relations.},

  abstract = {Avoiding dangerous climate change is one of the most urgent social risk issues we face today and understanding related public perceptions is critical to engaging the public with the major societal transformations required to combat climate change. Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance-temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty-in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.},

Survey data gathered from 2010 to 2019 of a representative sample of United States residents (N = 22,468) document greater increases in worry about climate change and, to a lesser degree, anger and guilt about climate change, within the two youngest generations relative to changes among Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent and Greatest Generations. Although generational differences were small and suggest overstatements of unique effects for younger generations, increases in younger generations' emotions transform into the two youngest generations reporting the strongest emotions in 2019. Over ten years, these differential shifts in emotions explain more substantial increases in the frequency of discussing climate in the youngest generations.},

Yet, the psychological and emotional distress and pain triggered by these transformations have been largely ignored, particularly among poor and marginalized populations whose livelihoods depend on the living land. Building upon key geographical concepts of landscapes and place and embodied engagements within, we focus on environmentally-induced distress and loss of belonging ('solastalgia') in the coupled context of environmental and climatic changes and internal migration in Ghana. We assess the differential emotional experiences and memory among those who migrate from deteriorating environments in the North to urban slums in the capital Accra and those who stay behind in these altered homes. We use participatory mapping and 'walking journeys' in northern regions to examine understandings of landscapes of everyday life and identify places that induce solastalgia. Results illustrate that the combination of withered crops, drying up of wells, loss of beauty, and deteriorating social networks trigger strong emotional responses, in particular feelings of sadness. We conclude that these emotional responses are expressions of solastalgia in what we call " hollow homes" where place and self of agrarian livelihoods undergo both figurative and literal desiccation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon has been a topic of intense study over the past several years. However, to visualise UHI model is still an issue. Common visualisation of UHI by using digital thematic maps shows that it is hard to perceive its impacts especially in a sophisticated micro-area such as in urbanized cities. Moreover, different building fa{\c c}ade's material gives different UHI value. Therefore, there is a need in computing and visualising this phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) perspectives. Recently, the development of 3D city modelling shows the potential of solving these gaps. This can be seen from the characteristics of 3D city models that are suitable in representing micro-areas (complex cities) for UHI studies. Based on this issue, this research aims to produce a 3D UHI model by using 3D city models as a tool for efficient and sustainable building design. The main objective is to produce a new approach in visualising UHI in 3D perspectives by instigating 3D city models. Thus, the UHI effect could be predicted precisely by calculating the building fa{\c c}ades value. This research explores the 3D shadow analysis, 3D solar radiation and 3D orientation analysis in UHI modelling via 3D city models. From the analyses, the results show that the 3D city models are capable in presenting the solar radiation value for each building fa{\c c}ade. Furthermore, this approach can be used to simulate future UHI analysis-prediction and advantageous for pre-development planning.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role for improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes in real-time. One of the most significant issues associated with smart city applications is solid waste management, which has a negative impact on our society's health and the environment. The traditional waste management process begins with waste created by city residents and disposed of in garbage bins at the source. Municipal department trucks collect garbage and move it to recycling centers on a fixed schedule. Municipalities and waste management companies fail to keep up with outdoor containers, making it impossible to determine when to clean them or when they are full. This work proposes an IoT-enabled solid waste management system for smart cities to overcome the limitations of the traditional waste management systems. The proposed architecture consists of two types of end sensor nodes: PBLMU (Public Bin Level Monitoring Unit) and HBLMU (Home Bin Level Monitoring Unit), which are used to track bins in public and residential areas, respectively. The PBLMUs and HBLMUs measure the unfilled level of the trash bin and its location data, process it, and transmit it to a central monitoring station for storage and analysis. An intelligent Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables the waste collection authority to view and evaluate the unfilled status of each trash bin. To validate the proposed system architecture, the following significant experiments were conducted: (a) Eight trash bins were equipped with PBLMUs and connected to a LoRaWAN network and another eight trash bins were equipped with HBLMUs and connected to a Wi-Fi network. The trash bins were filled with wastes at different levels and the corresponding unfilled levels of every trash bin were monitored through the intelligent GUI. (b) An experimental setup was arranged to measure the sleep current and active current contributions of a PBLMU to estimate its average current consumption. (c) The life expectancy of a PBLMU was estimated as approximately 70 days under hypothetical conditions.},

In two studies, we find that climate scientists (N = 44) experience greater emotional intensity about climate change than do students (N = 94) and the general population (N = 205), and that patterns of emotional responses explain differences in support for climate change policy. Scientists tied their emotional responses to concern about consequences of climate change to future generations and the planet, as well as personal identities associated with responsibility to act. Our findings suggest that ``objects of care'' that link people to climate change may be crucial to understanding why some people feel more strongly about the issue than others, and how emotions can prompt action.},

  abstract = {Climate change has been positioned as one of the most severe environmental threats facing us today. To address climate change, enhancing climate change risk perception and reducing climate change inaction are both critical. However, little research has touched on the issue of whether climate change risk perception is linked to climate change inaction in a negative manner. Moreover, there is still much unknown about the complex process behind this relationship, and the boundary conditions of this process awaits clarification. To address these gaps in the literature, two studies were conducted to first confirm the possible negative association between climate change risk perception and climate change inaction and, second, explore through a parallel mediational model whether climate change belief and environmental efficacy mediate simultaneously the relation between climate change risk perception and climate change inaction. Finally, a moderated sequential mediational model was used to investigate whether climate change risk perception is associated with climate change inaction through the sequential mediation of climate change belief and environmental efficacy, and to clarify underlying boundary conditions by analyzing the moderation of mindfulness as well. The results showed that, as expected, higher levels of climate change risk perception were related to less climate change inaction, and this relation was mediated by enhanced climate change belief and heightened environmental efficacy in a sequential manner. Furthermore, the sequential mediating effect of climate change belief and environmental efficacy was stronger among those who had a higher level of mindfulness. These findings advance the emerging research on climate change inaction by elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effect of climate change risk perception. Moreover, they extend the Domain-Context-Behavior (DCB) model and Gateway belief model (GBM). In practice, climate change education and climate change inaction interventions can be designed and implemented to nudge clean production, green supply chain and green consumption, which finally contribute to sustainable development and the `green transformation' of society.},

Until now, there has been no research on the psychosocial impact of living in an environment damaged by a volcanic eruption. We studied and compared the psychosocial impact of environmental damage on volcano survivors from two subdistricts{\textemdash}Cangkringan and Pakem. Cangkringan survivors affected by the 2010 eruption continue to live in a damaged environment. The Pakem subdistrict was damaged by eruptions of Mt Merapi in the 1990s but there is no recent damage to their environment. The Indonesian-Environmental Distress Scale (I-EDS), a translated revision of the original Environmental Distress Scale (EDS), was used to collect data. Exploratory statistical methods and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relative contributions of demographic variables on the psychosocial impact of living in an environment damaged by volcanic eruption. A total of 348 survivors of the Mt Merapi eruption participated in the survey. The mean I-EDS score for Cangkringan district was 15.8 (SD 1.6; range 11.8{\textendash}19.8) compared to 14.6 (SD 1.3; range 11.8{\textendash}18.3) for Pakem district (P {\textexclamdown} 0.001). This result was confirmed by multiple linear regression analysis showing further that older respondents (P {\textexclamdown} 0.001), unemployed and retired respondents (P = 0.007), and respondents with no formal school education (P = 0.037) had lower I-EDS scores compared to the respective reference groups. Survivors of the Mt Merapi eruption who continue to live in the environment damaged by the 2010 volcanic eruption experience environmental distress. Relevant interventions should target those from low sosioeconomic groups to deal with the distress.},

Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.},

The meta-analysis suggests that strong fear appeals produce high levels of perceived severity and susceptibility, and are more persuasive than low or weak fear appeals. The results also indicate that fear appeals motivate adaptive danger control actions such as message acceptance and maladaptive fear control actions such as defensive avoidance or reactance. It appears that strong fear appeals and high-efficacy messages produce the greatest behavior change, whereas strong fear appeals with low-efficacy messages produce the greatest levels of defensive responses. Future directions and practical implications are provided.},

  abstract = {The climate crisis is an unprecedented existential threat that causes disturbing emotions, such as anxiety. Recently, Clayton and Karazsia measured climate anxiety as ``a more clinically significant `anxious' response to climate change'' (2020, p. 9). To gain a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon from an empirical psychological perspective, we translated the core of the Climate Anxiety Scale into German and assessed potential correlates in a large German-speaking quota sample (N = 1011, stratified by age and gender). Overall, people reported low levels of climate anxiety. Climate anxiety correlated positively with general anxiety and depressiveness, avoidance of climate change in everyday life, frustration of basic psychological needs, pro-environmental behavioral intentions, and policy support. It correlated negatively with different forms of climate denial and was unrelated to ideological beliefs. We were not able to replicate the two dimensions found in the original scale. Moreover, we argue that items appear to measure a general climate-related emotional impairment, rather than distinctly and comprehensively capturing climate anxiety. Thus, we encourage researchers to rework the scale and include an emotional factor in future research efforts.},

The present study investigated individualist-collectivist differences in climate change inaction as well as the mediating role of perceived intractability. In Study 1, a survey of 182 undergraduates showed that greater perceived intractability of climate change was significantly related to a lower frequency of climate-friendly actions in the preceding 6 months. In Study 2, participants who were exposed to information concerning the intractability of climate change (experimental group, n = 98) reported a significantly greater perceived intractability of climate change and lower intention to assume a low-carbon lifestyle than those presented with neutral information (control group, n = 83). Based on Studies 1 and 2, participants with collectivist or individualist orientations were recruited from a pool of Chinese undergraduate students in Study 3. We found that participants with a more individualist orientation (n = 62) are more subject to perceived intractability, and less likely to take climate-friendly action than those with a more collectivist orientation (n = 94), and individualist/collectivist status affects climate change inaction through perceived intractability as mediator. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the promotion of public engagement with climate change by mitigating perceived intractability.},

  abstract = {Rapid and accurate disaster impact assessment is crucial for disaster emergency decision-making. The perception and behavioral characteristics of people derived from crowdsourced data, such as social media and mobile phone signaling data, can provide information sources for disaster assessment and assist disaster emergency management. This topic has attracted extensive attention from scholars. However, these data types are incomplete and have wide-ranging quality, which makes it difficult to evaluate the disaster. Social media data contain many public descriptions of disasters, but the spatial distribution is uneven. Mobile phone signaling data cover a wide range and are spatiotemporal continuous, but semantic information is lacking. Thus, this paper develops a disaster impact assessment method that integrates social media data and mobile signaling data based on a classification of social media data with a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN), anomaly detection in mobile signaling data, and feature mining of human activity. The result shows that social media and mobile signaling data complement each other well. The proposed method improves the assessment accuracy and provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of disasters. The results of this study provide reference for the combination of different sources of information for disaster response decisions.},

  abstract = {A vast number of pollutants are generated from on-road commuting vehicles, and there is an increasing need to explore vehicle emission monitoring and mitigation strategies. Traditionally, vehicle emissions can be monitored and measured directly from on-vehicle devices such as a sensor at the tailpipe, or based on expensive data collection tools such as roadside units; while another mainstream research estimates vehicle emissions by relying on the connection to the vehicle motions, which can approximately calculate vehicle emissions under certain traffic conditions. This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR) enabled digital twin platform for on-road emission monitoring, and it develops and evaluates eco-driving strategies within a specific area. The proposed approach, integrating a VR-based digital environment, a micro-simulation model for background traffic, and a Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator for emission estimation, offers an alternative to collect and examine vehicle emissions such as NOx under various traffic conditions. A case study on a central business area in Melbourne is conducted and eco-driving strategies are tested in two scenarios. The first scenario concerns the impact of hybrid electric vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles, which points to the long-term benefit of having controllable and cleaner modes of transportation as a strategy. Results showed that manipulating the penetration rate of emission-friendly engines or motions could reduce vehicle emissions effectively. The second scenario concerns the real-time eco-routing based on emission-optimum, which points to the short-term benefit of emission control strategies. Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to test drivers' responses toward routing options. Results showed that over 90\% of participants would follow the eco-routing recommendations completely. The presented study offers an alternative to data-generating, analyzing, and managing approaches for on-road emissions in urban transportation systems.},

This epidemic's effect on the waste composition and management and the impacts of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) on disease transmission or controlling are considered a compelling experience of living in the COVID-19 pandemic that can effectively control the process. This systematic review research was conducted to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the quantity of waste and MSWM. Searches were conducted in three databases (using keywords covid 19, coronaviruses, and waste), and among the published articles from 2019 to 2021, 56 ones were selected containing information on the quantity and waste management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 caused the quantity variation and composition change of MSW. COVID-19 also has significant effects on waste recycling, medical waste management, quantity, and littered waste composition. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed waste compounds' management activities and waste generation sources. Recognizing these issues can help plan MSWM more efficiently and reduce virus transmission risk through waste.},

The proposed method contains a face detection module based on the ensemble of three state-of-the-art face detectors, followed by a classification module with the ensemble of multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Each CNN model is initialized randomly and pre-trained on a larger dataset provided by the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) Challenge 2013. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on the training set of SFEW 2.0. To combine multiple CNN models, we present two schemes for learning the ensemble weights of the network responses: by minimizing the log likelihood loss, and by minimizing the hinge loss. Our proposed method generates state-of-the-art result on the FER dataset. It also achieves 55.96\% and 61.29\% respectively on the validation and test set of SFEW 2.0, surpassing the challenge baseline of 35.96\% and 39.13\% with significant gains.},

  abstract = {The currently consumption-driven society produces an enormous volume of waste every day. Continuous depletion of natural finite resources by urban populations is leading the globe to an uncertain future. Therefore, to prevent further depletion of global resources, sustainable consumption and a strategic waste management system would be required. It is evident that a significant number of global non-renewable resources such as cadmium, mercury and tellurium will experience permanent shortfall in global supply within the next two to three decades. Astonishingly, the current recycling rate of these very scarce metals is significantly low in all cities around the globe. The concept of the zero waste city includes a 100\% recycling of municipal solid waste and a 100\% recovery of all resources from waste materials. However, transforming currently over-consuming cities into zero waste cities is challenging. Therefore, this study aims to understand the key factors waste management systems in cities such as consumption, resource depletion and possible decoupling opportunity through implementing the ``zero waste city'' concept. The study proposes five significant principles for transforming current cities into zero waste cities in the context of long-term sustainability. A simultaneous and harmonized application of sustainable behaviour and consumption, product stewardship, a 100\% recycling and recovery of resources, legislated zero landfill and incineration are required to transform current city into a zero waste city.},

With the increased awareness of urban residents regarding safety, environmental protection, and health in recent years, it is necessary to logically organize municipal solid waste collection and transportation routes while also considering economic and social benefits. This article focuses on the optimization of the waste transportation routes of garbage trucks. With the objective of minimizing transportation costs and maximizing resident satisfaction, we establish a robust optimization model for the multi-trip collection and transportation of municipal solid waste in an uncertain environment. Resident satisfaction is defined as the penalty cost against a time window constraint. The Bertsimas robust optimization method is applied to characterize the uncertainty, and the decision-making scheme of the receiving route is used to adapt to waste volume changes. We conduct a case study based on real-world data for municipal solid waste collection and transportation in the Dongcheng District of Beijing, China. The solution is validated using the CPLEX program, and the validity of the model is verified. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of related parameters is conducted to study the impacts of variations in work hour limits and time windows on the total cost and service levels, as well as their relationships with the level of robustness. This could help decision-makers make reasonable choices based on actual conditions and to balance reductions in total cost with service level improvements.},

  abstract = {Background: The increase in solid waste generated per capita in Africa has not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in the capacity and funding to manage it. It is reported that less than 30\% of urban waste in developing countries is collected and disposed appropriately. The implications of poorly managed waste on health are numerous and depend on the nature of the waste, individuals exposed, duration of exposure and availability of interventions for those exposed. Objective: To present a framework for understanding the linkages between poor solid waste management, exposure and associated adverse health outcomes. The framework will aid understanding of the relationships, interlinkages and identification of the potential points for intervention. Methods: Development of the framework was informed by a review of literature on solid waste management policies, practices and its impact on health in developing countries. A configurative synthesis of literature was applied to develop the framework. Several iterations of the framework were reviewed by experts in the field. Each linkage and outcomes are described in detail as outputs of this study. Result: The resulting framework identifies groups of people at a heightened risk of exposure and the potential healthconsequences. Using the iceberg metaphor, the framework illustrates the pathways and potential burden of ill-health related to solid waste that is hidden but rapidly unfolding with our inaction. The existing evidence on the linkage between poor solid waste management and adverse health outcomes calls to action by all stakeholders in understanding, prioritizing, and addressing the issue of solid waste in our midst to ensure that our environment and health are preserved. Conclusion: A resulting framework developed in this study presents a clearer picture of the linkages between poor solid waste management and could guide research, policy and action.},
